Provide python code to solve the following task:
You are given N strings W_1,W_2,…,W_N consisting of lowercase English letters.
If one or more of these strings equal and, not, that, the, or you, then print Yes; otherwise, print No.
Constraints:
- N is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- 1≤|W_i|≤50 (|W_i| is the length of W_i.)
- W_i consists of lowercase English letters.
Input: N, W_1, W_2, ..., W_N
Output: Print the answer

",3,"Here is the python code to solve the given task:

```python
N = int(input())
words = []
for _ in range(N):
    word = input()
    words.append(word)

key_words = [""and"", ""not"", ""that"", ""the"", ""or"", ""you""]

if any(word in key_words for word in words):
    print(""Yes"")
else:
    print(""No"")
```

You can run this code by providing the input N followed by N strings separated by newlines, and it will output either ""Yes"" or ""No"" based on whether any of the strings are equal to the key words specified in the problem.","```python
N = int(input())
words = []
keywords = ['and', 'not', 'that', 'the', 'or', 'you']

for _ in range(N):
    word = input()
    if word in keywords:
        print(""Yes"")
        break
else:
    print(""No"")
``` 

This code takes as input the number of strings N, and then takes N strings as input. It checks if any of the input strings match the keywords 'and', 'not', 'that', 'the', or 'you'. If any of the strings match, it prints ""Yes"", otherwise it prints ""No"".","Here is the Python code to solve the task:

```python
N = int(input())
words = set([""and"", ""not"", ""that"", ""the"", ""you""])

for _ in range(N):
    word = input()
    if word in words:
        print(""Yes"")
        break
else:
    print(""No"")
```

You can input the values of N and the strings W_1, W_2, ..., W_N when prompted, and the code will output either ""Yes"" if any of the strings match the specified words, or ""No"" if none of them do."
