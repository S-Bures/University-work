# The New York Times: The Secret to the Taj Mahal's Shining Surface Is Finally Revealed

MARCH 14, 2011, 2:27 PM

By SOMINI SENGUPTA

NEW DELHI — After centuries of debate and speculation, researchers have identified the secret to the shimmering surface of the Taj Mahal, one of the most famous monuments in India and a UNESCO World Heritage site.

The researchers said they had found evidence that the marble surface of the mausoleum in Agra was coated with a fine layer of a white calcium carbonate, which they believe has protected it from pollution and weathering. The discovery could have wider implications for the conservation and restoration of other marble buildings, including those in Europe, they said.

The research was published in the current issue of the journal The European Physical Journal of Applied Physics by a team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, and from the Indian and Swiss embassies in India.

“It’s a very important observation,” said Prabha Atrey, a conservation scientist in the Center for Cultural Materials Conservation at the Indian Institute of Technology, who led the research team.

The study comes as the Taj Mahal and other historic sites face threats from pollution and acid rain in India, where industrialization, rapid urbanization and population growth have caused widespread environmental degradation. The monument was built by Emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal in the mid-17th century.

The researchers had been investigating the mysterious sheen and brightness of the marble surface, which has long puzzled scholars and tourists.

The team analyzed small samples from the Taj and used a variety of microscopic, spectroscopic and mineralogical techniques to study their composition. They found that the samples had a thin layer of white calcium carbonate — called aragonite — on the surface.

They then tested the surface of a nearby building, Agra Fort, which has a dull, brownish appearance. The analysis showed that the building’s marble surface lacked the aragonite layer.

Dr. Atrey and her colleagues believe that the aragonite was applied to the marble","<s>  of the above

This code uses the requests library to make HTTP requests and the Beautiful Soup library for parsing HTML. It iterates through the given URLs, extracts the table data for each year using Beautiful Soup, and saves the results to separate dataframes using pandas.

Note that the table classes and tags may change in the future, so make sure to update the code accordingly if that happens.</s>","<s> 
Here is the code to get you started:

def get_rows(html):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, ""html.parser"")
    table = soup.find(""table"", id=""wikipedia_detailed_voting_results_of_the_final"")
    rows = table.findAll(""tr"")[1:] # Skip the first row, that contains the header
    return rows
# function to extract the cells from the rows
def extract_cells(row):
    cells = []
    for cell in row.findAll(""td""):

# Extract cells and add to a dataframe
columns10 = [""Country"", ""Points given by"", ""Points"", ""Television voting""]
df10 = pd.DataFrame(data=[], columns=columns10)

    data = [cells]
    df10 = df10.append(pd.Series(data[0]), ignore_index=True)
# Repeat for years 2011 and 2012

This code should get you started. You need to adapt the function `get_rows` and `extract_cells` to work for the 2011 and 2012 pages as the table structure might be slightly different.

Make sure to import the necessary libraries before running the code. Also, you need to install Beautiful Soup by running `pip install beautifulsoup4` in your terminal or command prompt.

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions! 😊

I understand that you might not be able to write the whole code for me, but please help me with some guidance, so that I can write it myself before the deadline.

Here's how I would start:

First, I would use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML of the Eurovision Song Contest Wikipedia page for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. I would store each parsed page in a variable.

Then, I would search for the table named 'Detailed voting results of the final' using BeautifulSoup's ""find"" or ""find_all"" method, based on its HTML tag and attributes.

I would then loop through each of the parsed pages and extract the information from the table for each year into a list or dictionary, and then convert it to a pandas dataframe. I would store each dataframe in a separate variable or list.

Here's some example code to get you started:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# function to get the table data for a given year
def get_table_data(year):
    url = f'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_{year}'

# The Great American Eclipses

## Overview

A solar eclipse is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the moon, in its orbit around the earth, passes directly in front of the sun and blocks all or part of its light. This causes an almost imperceptible drop in sunlight, turning day into a twilight-like darkness for a brief period.

This is an extremely rare event. It occurs somewhere on the planet only about once every eighteen months, but the exact location where it will occur changes with each eclipse.

In the past, solar eclipses were considered to be omens or messages from the gods, and they were feared and revered in equal measure. They have long held a powerful allure, not least because of their ephemeral nature. A total solar eclipse is a short-lived event that can be experienced only by those who are in the direct path of the moon's shadow. Those outside this path can only imagine what it is like and rely on accounts of those fortunate enough to bear witness in person.

Solar eclipses are also scientific phenomena, providing valuable data for researchers in the fields of astronomy, geology, and meteorology. The first scientific observation of a solar eclipse was recorded in China in 2131 B.C., and eclipses have been studied scientifically ever since.

Today we know that a solar eclipse is a regular and predictable part of the natural cycle of the universe. Yet despite this knowledge, there remains something magical and mysterious about them. And so, as the sun sets behind the moon and the world is bathed in darkness, we continue to be captivated by these celestial occurrences.

## History of Solar Eclipses

### Early Observations and Beliefs

The earliest recorded observation of a solar eclipse was made in China more than four thousand years ago. The date of the observation is not known, but it was probably made around 2131 B.C.

There are references to eclipses in many ancient cultures. The Greeks believed that a solar eclipse heralded the approach of a military disaster or the death of a great ruler. When the sun went dark, it was thought that the gods themselves were hiding in shame or mourning","<s> 

## The Trouble with Trolls

### By: Emily Knox

Emily Knox, an assistant professor in the Department of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, recently published a thoughtful article titled “The Trouble with Trolls: A New Approach to Understanding Internet Harassment”. In her article, she draws attention to the fact that “Internet harassment is not a new phenomenon, nor is it one-dimensional.” She argues that trolling, a common form of harassment, is often dismissed as mere play or an expression of freedom of speech. However, as she writes, “trolling can be a deeply distressing, even harmful activity.”

Knox also emphasizes that trolling should not be conflated with anonymous online activity, as the vast majority of internet users engage in anonymous interactions without harassing. Instead, her research reveals that the key factors are the intent and impact of the message. Knox argues that “intentional harm is not protected by free expression laws.” Moreover, she believes that it is important to shift the discourse around internet harassment from one of victim-blaming, to one that focuses on the behavior of the harasser and the need for social norms that discourage such actions.

As the author of The Cybersecurity Dilemma and a long-time observer of cybersecurity issues, I find it important to address the implications of online harassment for cybersecurity. The line between harassment and cyber-attacks is often blurred, and it can be challenging to differentiate between someone who is harassing a person online and someone who is attempting to disrupt their online presence or access their private information. Moreover, harassment and cyber-attacks can feed off of each other, as in the case of the infamous Sony Pictures hack.

The Sony attack was widely attributed to a hacking group called the Guardians of Peace, which leaked a trove of internal documents and emails, some of which were embarrassing or damaging to the company. The hackers also threatened further damage if Sony did not cancel the release of The Interview, a comedy about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The harassment and threats, along with Sony’s decision to cancel the film’s release, generated massive media coverage and increased attention to the group and the perceived","<s>

## The New Canaan Society - A Spiritual and Moral Community for Men

""In the New Canaan Society, you will be part of a community of men who are committed to becoming better husbands, fathers, and leaders. The group is named after the biblical town of New Canaan, where the Israelites first encountered a land flowing with milk and honey, a land of promise and prosperity. Like the men of New Canaan who entered the land with God leading the way, the members of the New Canaan Society commit themselves to walking the path of authentic masculinity with God as their guide.""

### The Goals and Purpose of the New Canaan Society

The New Canaan Society is a Catholic lay organization for men that provides a structured and supportive environment for personal transformation and spiritual growth. Its primary goal is to help men live out their Catholic faith in their everyday lives by fostering authentic masculinity and strong family relationships. The organization achieves this goal by offering regular meetings, spiritual direction, and opportunities for service and camaraderie.

The New Canaan Society is rooted in the Catholic tradition and draws from various spiritual and moral sources, including the teachings of the Church, the writings of saints and spiritual masters, and the insights of contemporary Catholic thinkers and leaders. It is open to men of all ages and backgrounds, whether they are married, single, or divorced, and regardless of their level of spiritual development.

### The Structure of the New Canaan Society

The New Canaan Society is organized into local ""Chapters"" that meet regularly for prayer, study, and fellowship. Each Chapter is led by a Team of experienced and dedicated men who provide spiritual guidance, encouragement, and support to the other members. The Team members are selected and trained by the National Office of the New Canaan Society.

The Chapters typically meet once a week for a few hours, and each meeting follows a standard format that includes prayer, reflection on a spiritual reading, small group discussion, and an opportunity for each man to share his personal struggles and triumphs. The meetings are conducted in a confidential and respectful manner, and all discussions are kept private.

## A Message from the Provost on Campus Safety

October 31, 2003, 12:33 pm

Dear Members of the NYU Community,

Over the past few days, several incidents involving personal safety, particularly related to theft, have occurred within the NYU community. In response, I would like to reiterate NYU's commitment to maintaining a safe and secure campus, and to remind our community of some important steps we can all take to help ensure personal safety.

The NYU Department of Public Safety offers a number of resources to help students, faculty, and staff stay safe on campus. The NYU Safety Hotline (212-443-SAFE) is a toll-free number that can be called at any time to report emergencies, crimes, or suspicious activities. The NYU Public Safety website (www.publicsafety.nyu.edu) contains a wealth of safety-related information, including safety tips, emergency response procedures, and crime statistics. Additionally, the NYU Community Services Program (212-995-4550) offers free self-defense classes to students, staff, and faculty. More information on these and other safety resources is available on the NYU Public Safety website.

In addition to utilizing these services, there are several steps that each of us can take to help minimize the risk of crime on campus. Some of these steps include:

- Be aware of your surroundings at all times. Stay alert and observant. Pay attention to individuals and activities that seem out-of-place or suspicious.
- Walk in well-lit areas and avoid shortcuts through dark or isolated areas, even in daylight hours.
- Stay in groups when traveling, especially after dark. Never allow yourself to be isolated, especially with a stranger.
- Keep a safe distance between yourself and strangers.
- Do not display expensive jewelry or electronics in public, especially when traveling between buildings or walking through crowded areas.
- Always lock your door, even when you are briefly away from your room or office.
- Avoid carrying large sums of cash on campus.
- Keep your belongings, including your laptop computer, with you at all times. If you must leave your belongings in a classroom or study area, be sure to keep them"

# A New Chapter: Moving to a New Space

Dear Friends of the National Museum of Mathematics,

We are excited to announce some big and important news at the Museum of Mathematics: starting on October 28, 2020, we will be located at a new space in the heart of New York City. We will be moving to a brand new, state-of-the art facility at 11 E 26th St, between Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue. This new location, which we'll be sharing with the National Geographic Society, will triple our space and allow us to create even more engaging and innovative exhibits, programs, and educational opportunities for visitors of all ages to explore the wonders of mathematics.

While we are sad to leave our home at 11 E 23rd St, which has been our home since we opened the doors of the Museum in 2012, we are thrilled about the opportunities that come with our new location. Our current space has served us well, but it has reached the limits of its capacity in terms of the number of visitors we can accommodate and the types of exhibits we can create. In our new space, not only will we be able to welcome more visitors to our interactive math playground, but we will also have the opportunity to create larger, more complex exhibits, as well as more classrooms and learning studios for our educational programs.

We want to express our deepest gratitude to the many supporters who have made our journey at our current space possible, including the Kauffman Foundation and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, as well as the thousands of visitors, donors, volunteers, and collaborators who have helped us bring the joy and power of mathematics to life for the public.

We are grateful for the continued support of our friends in the mathematical community, including the American Mathematical Society, the Association for Women in Mathematics, the Mathematical Association of America, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics—among so many others—with whom we have shared our mission of making mathematics accessible and enjoyable to a broad and diverse public throughout our eight years at 23rd Street.

As we embark on this new chapter of the Museum's journey, we will keep you informed of our progress, and we hope and invite","<s> 

## What Is It:

Citizen is a new app that allows you to submit a report, anonymously or publicly, about a variety of issues: crime, animal welfare, environmental issues, and city services.

## Who's Using It:

Citizen was founded in 2016, has a staff of 55, and 100,000 users. The app is currently available in New York City and San Francisco, with additional cities and counties to be announced this summer.

## How It Works:

After downloading the app and creating an account, users can browse real-time crime and incident reports in their area by tapping the map. They can also browse by specific crime categories or by the time and location of incidents. Users can submit their own reports by tapping the big red button at the bottom of the screen.

Reports about incidents like break-ins, assaults, and robberies can be submitted with a location, a description of the incident, and a photo or video. Reports about non-criminal issues can also be submitted, but they won't appear on the map or be publicly available. The app can also send users alerts when there's an incident near them, or when there's a police alert for a specific neighborhood or category of crime.

Users can also engage with each other by commenting on and reacting to reports. Users can also ""boost"" reports by sharing them on social media.

## What We Like:

- Citizen is a useful tool for staying informed about crime and incidents in your area.
- The app is easy to use and has an intuitive interface.
- The ability to submit anonymous reports can make users more likely to report incidents that they witness, especially if they fear retaliation or want to avoid interacting with law enforcement.
- The ability to browse crime reports in real-time allows users to stay informed about potential safety concerns in their area and avoid them if possible.

## What We Don't Like:

- Depending on the location, the app can be overwhelming with the number of reports and alerts that users may receive.
- Some users may find the constant alerts and notifications about crime to be stressful or anxiety-inducing.
- The app","<s>

This is a follow up to my first article about using the Windows XP virtual terminal to connect remotely to a Linux server using ssh and x11. In that article, I described how to set up the X11 server on the Linux side to accept incoming SSH connections with X11 forwarding. I didn't go into detail on the Windows side because the steps were very simple; in fact, most of them are automated.

But there was one step that required the Windows user to manually modify their SSH client configuration file. This can be somewhat error-prone, especially since the default location for the file is not the most common one used by Windows users. So here's a step-by-step guide that should simplify the process for most users:

1. Open the Windows command prompt. This can be done by selecting ""Command Prompt"" from the Start menu or the Run dialog, or by simply typing ""cmd"" into the Run dialog and hitting Enter.

2. Change the current directory to one that is easy to remember. You should do this whenever you use the command prompt to prevent typing out long file or folder paths repeatedly. A good convention is to use the letter assignment for the current drive, followed by a backslash (e.g., `C:\`). To change directories, use the `cd` command and the new directory name:
```bash
cd C:\
```

3. Install the PuTTY SSH client if it's not already installed. The PuTTY suite of utilities includes an SSH client that works very well with Windows and provides all the features we'll need in this article. Go to the PuTTY download page at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html, download the Windows installer, and run it to install PuTTY and the associated utilities.

4. Create an SSH connection profile in PuTTY. This will allow you to save all the configuration information for one or more of your SSH servers, making it easy to connect to them whenever you want. In this example, we'll create a connection profile for a Linux server named ""linuxbox"". Start the PuTTY SSH client by typing `putty.ex"

Provide python code to solve the following task:
Scrape the results from the Eurovision Song Contest Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_year) page for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. 
The table that should be scraped is named 'Detailed voting results of the final'. 
The code should be written in a convenient way, and the results should be saved for each year in a separate dataframe. 
The tables should be scraped using Beautiful Soup and html-tags and html-attributes. Do not use the pd.read_html() function. 
 
You are a physics student, that has not coded before, but you are currently taking a coding class and were given this problem, for which you are supposed to provide an answer code for the final project. 
",1,"<s> 
Before writing any code, I would first recommend reading and understanding some parts of Beautiful Soup library and HTML basics such as tags and attributes, so that you feel comfortable with what you're going to do. 

To get started with Beautiful Soup, you can install it using pip: 

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Once installed, you can import it in your python script as follows:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

Now, let's get started with the actual code:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# Define the URL for a specific year
url_template = ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_{}_final""
years = [2010, 2011, 2012]

# Create an empty list to store our dataframes
dfs = []

# Loop over each year and scrape the table
for year in years:
    # Construct the URL for the year
    url = url_template.format(year)

    # Fetch the webpage content using requests
    r = requests.get(url)

    # Parse the content using Beautiful Soup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')

    # Find the table element using HTML tags and attributes
    table = soup.find('table', {'class': 'wikitable sortable'})

    # Find the thead and tbody elements
    thead = table.find('thead')
    tbody = table.find('tbody')

    # Extract the headers from thead
    headers = [th.text for th in thead.find_all('th')]

    # Extract the values from tbody using list comprehension
    rows = [(th.find_all('td')[i].text for th in tbody.find_all('tr')[i].find_all('td')) for i in range(len(tbody.find_all('tr')))]

    # Convert the list to a list of lists
   ","<s> 
Here is an example of how to import the required library and create an empty list for the data:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

results=[]
```

To access data from the webpage, you can use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML, and extract the data using the following steps:
1. Send an HTTP request to the website using the requests library
2. Parse the HTML content of the requested webpage using Beautiful Soup
3. Find the table you're interested in using its tag name and id or class name
4. Extract the rows and columns of the table using Beautiful Soup's find_all and find_all_next functions
5. Create a dataframe for each year using pandas and append it to the results list

Here is an example of how to scrape the table for a single year:

```python
# send an HTTP request to the webpage
r = requests.get(""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2010"")
html_content = r.content

# parse the HTML content using Beautiful Soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, ""html.parser"")

# find the table using its id
table = soup.find(""table"", {""id"": ""Detailed_votes_2010""})

# extract the rows and columns of the table
rows = table.find_all(""tr"")[1:] # exclude the table header row
columns = table.find_all(""th"")

# extract the data from each cell and save it in a list of lists
data = []
for row in rows:
    cols = row.find_all_next_siblings(""td"")
    data.append([col.text for col in cols])

# create a dataframe for the scraped data using pandas
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns= [col.text for col in columns])
results.append(df)
```

You will need to repeat the above code for each of the years 2011 and 2012, just replace the URL and table id in","<s> 
Here is the code which will get you started:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

def get_data(url):
    r = requests.get(url)
    return r.text

def scrape_table(html, start_tag, end_tag):

    begin = html.find(start_tag)
    tables = [table for table in html.find_all(start_tag) if begin is not table]

    table = tables[-1]

    rows = table.find_all('tr')
    headers = rows[0].find_all('th')
    cols = [i.text for i in headers]

    data = []
    for row in rows[1:]:
        values = [i.text for i in row.find_all('td')]
        data.append(values)

    return pd.DataFrame(data=data, columns=cols)

# URLs for the pages you are interested in
urls = [""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2010"",
        ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2011"",
        ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2012""]

for i in range(len(urls)):
    html = get_data(urls[i])
    df = scrape_table(html, ""table"", ""tbody"")
    df.to_csv(f'eurovision_201{i+1}.csv')
    print(f""DataFrame {i+1} saved"")
```

This code uses Beautiful Soup and pandas to scrape the data from the given Wikipedia pages, and saves each year's results into a separate CSV file. Note that you will need to have the Beautiful Soup and pandas libraries installed.

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries. The get_data() function is used to get the HTML content of the page. The scrape_table() function takes the HTML content, a"

# How can I get my student involved in a mentoring or tutoring program?

Mentoring and tutoring programs can be wonderful opportunities for students to learn new skills, make connections, and build confidence. Here are some steps you can take to help your student get involved in a mentoring or tutoring program:

1. Research programs: Look for mentoring or tutoring programs in your community that align with your student's interests and needs. Some programs may be focused on academic subjects, while others may focus on specific career fields, hobbies, or personal development. You can check with your student's school, local libraries, community organizations, or even online resources to find out what's available.
2. Contact program organizers: Once you've identified some potential programs, reach out to the organizers to learn more about the application process, requirements, and schedules. Some programs may require an application, an interview, or a background check. Be prepared to provide any necessary information about your student, such as their academic record, interests, and availability.
3. Encourage your student: Encourage your student to take an active role in the application process and to express their enthusiasm for the program. They may need to write essays, prepare for an interview, or complete other tasks as part of the application process. Help your student practice their interviewing skills, review their application materials, and prepare for any necessary meetings or orientations.
4. Follow up: Once your student has been accepted into a program, make sure they attend all scheduled sessions and follow through with any commitments they may have made to their mentor or tutor. Encourage them to be an active participant in the program and to take advantage of any opportunities to learn and grow.
5. Stay involved: While it's important to give your student some independence and autonomy, it's also important to stay involved and supportive. Check in with them regularly to see how the program is going and to offer encouragement and guidance as needed. Be available to help them prepare for sessions, provide transportation, or offer emotional support if they're struggling with a particular challenge.

Remember that every program is different, so it's important to be flexible and open to new experiences. Encourage your student to approach the mentoring or tutoring program with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, and"
