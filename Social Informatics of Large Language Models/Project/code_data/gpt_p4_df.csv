To achieve this task, follow the given steps:
- create a function that receives the mentioned input: height and width of the chocolate bar, number of friends, and exponential number for each friend in order. 
- check if the values given as input fulfill the constraints
- check if the choclate bar can be divide so that each friend is able to optain a piece of the asked for size.
- return the answer
