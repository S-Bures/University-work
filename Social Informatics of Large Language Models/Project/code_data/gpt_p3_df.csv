In this code:
- We define a function `max_blue_jewels` that takes N, X, and Y as input.
- We check if the given constraints are met.

To achieve this task, follow the given steps:
- create a function that receives the mentioned input, being the number of jewels, the number of blue jewels that can be exchanged in the first transaction option
and the number of blue jewels that can be exchanged in the secon transaction option. 
- check for the given constraints
- provide code to check the resulting jewels given a certain transaction
- return the output
Example: Input of 2, 3 and 4: I can obtain 12 blue jewels of level 1 by the following conversions.
First, he converts a red jewel of level 2 into a red jewel of level 1 and 3 blue jewels of level 2. After this operation, I have 1 red jewel of level 1 and 3 blue jewels of level 2.
Next, I repeat the following conversion 3 times: converting a blue jewel of level 2 into a red jewel of level 1 and 4 blue jewels of level 1.
After these operations, I have 4 red jewels of level 1 and 12 blue jewels of level 1. I cannot perform a conversion anymore. I cannot obtain more than 12 blue jewels of level 1, so the answer is 12.

Provide python code to solve the following task:
I have a red jewel of level N. (He has no other jewels). I can do either of the following operations any number of times.
- Convert a red jewel of level n (n is at least 2) into ""a red jewel of level (n-1) and X blue jewels of level n"".
- Or Convert a blue jewel of level n (n is at least 2) into ""a red jewel of level (n-1) and Y blue jewels of level (n-1)"".
I want as many blue jewels of level 1 as possible. At most, how many blue jewels of level 1 can he obtain by the operations?
