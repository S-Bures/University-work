In this input, a year consists of 31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+31+30+31=365 days.
Let us find the middle day, which is the((365+1)/2=183)-th day.
- Months 1,2,3,4,5,6 contain a total of181 days.
- Day 1 of month 7 is the 182-th day.
- Day 2 of month 7 is the 183-th day.
Thus, the answer is day
2 of month 7.
