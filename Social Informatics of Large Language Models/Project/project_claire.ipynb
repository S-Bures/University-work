It first calculates the total number of days in the year by summing all the monthly days.\n","\n","To find the middle month, we calculate the middle index `mid_month` by adding 1 to the total number of days and then dividing by 2, and rounding up to the nearest integer using the integer division operator `//`. Then we iterate through the months until we reach the middle month by comparing the sum of the days in the previous months with the middle index `mid_month`.\n","\n","After finding the middle month `a`, we calculate the middle day `b` by summing the days in the previous months and finding the day number within that total that corresponds to the middle day of the year. We do this by adding 1 to the sum of days in the previous months and taking the remainder with the total number of days in the current month. This remainder represents the position of the middle day within the current month.\n","\n","Note: The example given in the code snippet has three months with the specified lengths, but the function can handle any number of months (up to 100).</s> \n","\n"," --------------\n","\n","current row: 11\n","prompt_type: non_exp_persona\n"," position of prompt: 3\n"," run_1 <s> \n","Example:\n","Input:\n","4\n","28 28 29 31\n","\n","Output:\n","2 15\n","\n","\n","Here's the python code to solve the problem:\n","\n","```python\n","import math\n","\n","# Function to calculate the sum of months' durations\n","def sum_months_durations(mon_dur):\n","    return sum(mon_dur)\n","\n","# Function to find the middle day in a single month\n","def middle_day_in_month(num_days):\n","    # Middle day in an odd-lengthed month is the floor division of total days by 2\n","    # then we add 1 to get the actual day, since we started the counting from 1\n","    return math.floor((num_days + 1) / 2)\n","\n","# Function to find the middle day of the year\n","def middle_day_of_the_year(mon_dur):\n","    total_days = sum_months_durations(mon_dur)\n","    return middle_day_in_month(total_days)\n","\n","# Main function\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    M = int(input().split()[0])\n","    months_durations = input().split()[1:]\n","\n","    months_durations = [int(x) for x in months_durations]\n","\n","    # Check if the sum of months' durations is odd\n","    if len(months_durations) and sum_months_durations(months_durations) % 2 != 1:\n","        print(\"Input data is invalid.
