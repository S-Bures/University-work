Q: What is the probability that 4 digit numbers which are formed from the following numbers are even numbers if no digit is repeated? 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 
A: ","To form a 4-digit number, the total number of possible arrangements is 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

For the number to be even, the last digit must be either 2, 6, or 8 since these are the only even digits available. That gives us 3 choices for the last digit.

For the first digit, it cannot be 0, so there are 4 choices for the first digit.

For the second and third digits, since no digit can be repeated, there are 3 choices for the second digit and 2 choices for the third digit.

Therefore, the total number of even 4-digit numbers that can be formed is 3 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 72.

So, the probability of forming an even 4-digit number is 72/120 = 3/5 = 0.6. 

Therefore, the probability that a 4 digit numbers formed from the given digits is an even number if no digit is repeated is 0.6 or 3/5.","To find the probability that a 4-digit number formed from the given numbers is even, we need to find the total number of possible 4-digit numbers that can be formed using the given numbers and then find the number of 4-digit numbers that are even.

Total number of possible 4-digit numbers that can be formed without repetition = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 120

To form an even number, the units place must be either 2, 6, or 8. So there are 3 choices for the units place. 

For the thousands, hundreds, and tens place, we have 4 choices for each place (since we cannot repeat digits).

So, the total number of even 4-digit numbers = 3 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 192

Therefore, the probability of forming an even 4-digit number = Number of even 4-digit numbers / Total number of possible 4-digit numbers

Q: What is the probability that 4 digit numbers which are formed from the following numbers are even numbers if no digit is repeated? 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 
A: ","To find the probability of 4-digit numbers formed using the given numbers (2, 5, 6, 8, 9) where no digit is repeated and the number is even, follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of possible 4-digit numbers that can be formed using the given digits without repetition.
Since no digit is repeated, the total number of possibilities for the 4-digit number is 5 choices for the first digit, 4 choices for the second digit, 3 choices for the third digit, and 2 choices for the fourth digit.
Therefore, the total number of 4-digit numbers without repetition is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 = 120.

2. Determine the number of even 4-digit numbers that can be formed using the given digits without repetition.
An even number always ends in 2, 6, or 8 when using the given digits. Therefore, the last digit can be chosen in 3 ways (2, 6, or 8). The first digit can be chosen in 4 ways (since it cannot be zero or an even digit), the second digit in 3 ways, and the third digit in 2 ways.
So, the number of even 4-digit numbers without repetition is 4 x 3 x 2 x 3 = 72.

3. Calculate the probability of forming an even 4-digit number without repetition using the given digits.
The probability is the number of favorable outcomes (even 4-digit numbers) divided by the total number of outcomes.
Probability = Number of even 4-digit numbers / Total number of 4-digit numbers
Probability = 72 / 120
Probability = 3 / 5
Therefore, the probability that a 4-digit number formed using the given digits without repetition is even is 3/5.","To find the probability of forming a 4-digit even number using the given numbers without repetitions, we need to calculate the total number of possible 4-digit numbers and then find the total number of possible even 4-digit numbers.

Total number of possible 4-digit numbers without repetitions: 
Since we can't repeat digits, there are 5 choices for the first digit, 4 choices for the second digit, 3 choices for the third digit, and 2 choices for the fourth digit. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit numbers without repetitions = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 = 120

Total number of possible even 4-digit numbers without repetitions:
For a number to be even, the last digit must be either 2, 6, or 8. Since we can't repeat digits, there are 3 choices for the last digit, 3 choices for the first digit (since it can't be 0 or an even number), 3 choices for the second digit, and 2 choices for the third digit. Therefore, the total number of even 4-digit numbers without repetitions = 3 x 3 x 3 x 2 = 54

So, the probability of forming a 4-digit even number using the given numbers without repetitions is:
P = (Total number of even 4-digit numbers) / (Total number of 4-digit numbers)
P = 54 / 120
P = 9 / 20

Therefore, the probability is 9/20.","To find the probability that a 4-digit number formed from the given numbers is even, we have to calculate the number of possible even numbers divided by the total number of possible 4-digit numbers.

First, let's calculate the total number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed from the given numbers without any repetition. This can be done by calculating the permutations of 5 numbers taken 4 at a time.

Total number of ways = 5P4 = 5! / (5-4)! = 5x4x3x2 = 120

Next, let's calculate the number of possible even numbers. For a number to be even, its unit digit must be one of the even numbers i.e. 2, 6 or 8. Since no repetition is allowed, there are 3 choices for the unit digit.

For the thousands digit, we have 4 choices (since we can't use 0) and for the hundreds digit and tens digit, we have 3 choices.

So, the total number of even 4-digit numbers = 3x4x3x2 = 72

Therefore, the probability of selecting an even 4-digit number from the given numbers without repetition is:
Probability = Number of even 4-digit numbers / Total number of 4-digit numbers 
                     = 72 / 120

Therefore, the total number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed with the given conditions is 3*4*3*2 = 72.

Out of these 72 numbers, only half will be even since for each even unit digit, there is only one even number options and one odd number option for the tens place.

3. If three quarters of the remaining raspberries are turned into sorbet, he will have 96 * (3/4) = 72 raspberries turned into sorbet.

4. The number of raspberries left after turning some into jam and sorbet is 96 - 72 = 24 raspberries.

Therefore, Joseph will have 24 raspberries left after the entire process.","First, we need to find the total number of raspberries collected by Joseph. Since there are 12 plants, each with 24 raspberries, the total number of raspberries is:

Next, Joseph turns a third of the raspberries into jam, which is:

1/3 * 288 raspberries = 96 raspberries

The remaining raspberries after making jam are:

288 raspberries - 96 raspberries = 192 raspberries

Finally, three-quarters of the remaining raspberries are turned into sorbet, which is:

3/4 * 192 raspberries = 144 raspberries

Therefore, the number of raspberries left after making jam and sorbet is:

Now, to calculate the probability, we need to divide the number of favorable outcomes (even numbers) by the total number of outcomes.

Number of even 4-digit numbers = 3 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 18

Probability = 18 / 72 = 1 / 4 = 0.25

Q: What is the probability that 4 digit numbers which are formed from the following numbers are even numbers if no digit is repeated? 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 
A: ","To solve this problem, we first need to figure out how many ways we can form a 4-digit number using the given numbers without repeating any digit.

There are 5 choices for the first digit (2, 5, 6, 8, or 9), 4 choices for the second digit (excluding the one already used), 3 choices for the third digit, and 2 choices for the fourth digit. This gives us a total of 5*4*3*2 = 120 different 4-digit numbers that can be formed.

Next, we need to find out how many of these numbers are even. An even number must end in either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since we are not allowed to repeat any digits, the only even digits we can use for the last digit are 2, 6, and 8. Therefore, there are 3 choices for the last digit. The other 3 digits can be arranged in 4*3*2 = 24 ways.

So the total number of 4-digit even numbers that can be formed without repeating any digit is 3*24 = 72.

Therefore, the probability of forming an even number is 72/120 = 3/5 = 0.6, or 60%.","To form a 4-digit number that is even, the last digit must be either 2, 6, or 8.

First, to calculate the total number of possible 4-digit numbers using the given numbers without repetition, we must find the total number of permutations.

Total number of permutations = 5P4 = 5! / (5-4)! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 = 120

Next, we need to find the number of 4-digit numbers that end in 2, 6, or 8.

Numbers that end in 2:
There are 4 choices for the last digit (2, 5, 6, or 8) and 3 choices for the first digit (the remaining 3 numbers), and then 2 choices for the second digit, and 1 choice for the third digit. This gives us 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 numbers that end in 2.

Similarly, for numbers that end in 6 or 8, we get 24 numbers each.

Total number of even 4-digit numbers = 24 + 24 + 24 = 72

Therefore, the probability of getting an even 4-digit number is:

1. The total number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed using the given digits (2, 5, 6, 8, 9) without repetition is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 120.

2. Now we need to determine how many of these numbers are even. An even number must end in either 2, 6, or 8. Since we are not repeating digits, the units place has 3 options (2, 6, or 8).

3. For the first three digits (thousands, hundreds, tens), we have 4 options for the thousands place, 3 options for the hundreds place (since one of the digits is already used in the thousands place), and 2 options for the tens place (since two digits are already used in the thousands and hundreds place).

4. Therefore, the total number of even 4-digit numbers that can be formed without repeating digits is 4 * 3 * 2 * 3 = 72.

5. Finally, the probability of selecting an even number from the total pool of numbers is given by the number of even numbers divided by the total number of numbers:

    Probability = 72/120
                         = 3/5
                         = 0.6 or 60%

Therefore, the probability that a 4-digit number formed from the given digits without repetition is an even number is 60%."
10,cot,e,"Q: Sam has 5 machines that every hour produce 3 widgets each. If he runs the machines each for 4 hours, then drops and breaks half of the widgets, how many intact does he have left? 
A: Every hour he produces 3 widgets per machine and has 5 machines so he produces 3 widgets x 5 machines = 15 widgets per hour. After 4 hours he will have 15 widgets/hour x 4 hours = 60 widgets. If he drops and breaks half then he has 60 / 2 = 30 intact widgets left. 
Q: Joseph collects raspberries from 12 plants that have 24 raspberries each. If he turns a third of the raspberries into jam and three quarters of the remainder is turned into sorbet, how many raspberries are left? 
A: ","First, find the total number of raspberries collected: 12 plants x 24 raspberries/plant = 288 raspberries
Next, find how many raspberries he turns into jam: 288 raspberries / 3 = 96 raspberries
Subtract the raspberries turned into jam to find the remainder: 288 raspberries - 96 raspberries = 192 raspberries
Find the number of raspberries turned into sorbet: 192 raspberries x 3/4 = 144 raspberries
Subtract the raspberries turned into sorbet to find the final amount of raspberries left: 192 raspberries - 144 raspberries = 48 raspberries left.","Joseph collects 12 plants x 24 raspberries per plant = 288 raspberries in total. If he turns a third into jam, he will have 288 raspberries / 3 = 96 raspberries remaining. Then, he turns 3/4 of the remaining raspberries into sorbet, so he will have 96 raspberries x 3/4 = 72 raspberries left after making sorbet.","Joseph collects 12 plants x 24 raspberries = 288 raspberries total. If he turns a third into jam, he will have 288 raspberries / 3 = 96 raspberries left. If three quarters of the remainder are turned into sorbet, he will have 96 raspberries x 3/4 = 72 raspberries left."
11,cot,m,"Q: What is the probability of forming a three-digit number, without repetition of digits, from the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, and it being a multiple of 3? 
A: Calculate the number of permutations of the numbers. For the hunQ: What is the probability that 4 digit numbers which are formed from the following numbers are even numbers if no digit is repeated? 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 
A: ","To calculate the probability of forming a 4-digit even number without repetition from the set {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}, we first need to determine the total number of possible permutations.

There are 5 choices for the thousands place (except 0), 4 choices for the hundreds place, 3 choices for the tens place, and 2 choices for the units place. This results in a total of 5*4*3*2 = 120 permutations.

Now, we need to determine how many of these permutations result in an even number. An even number must end in either 2, 6, or 8.

If the even digit is in the thousands place, there are 4 choices for the thousands place, 3 choices for the hundreds place, 2 choices for the tens place, and 1 choice for the units place. This results in 4*3*2*1 = 24 permutations where the even digit is in the thousands place.

If the even digit is in the hundreds place, there are 3 choices for the hundreds place, 2 choices for the thousands place, 2 choices for the tens place, and 1 choice for the units place. This results in 3*2*2*1 = 12 permutations where the even digit is in the hundreds place.

If the even digit is in the tens place, there are 2 choices for the tens place, 2 choices for the thousands place, 3 choices for the hundreds place, and 1 choice for the units place. This results in 2*2*3*1 = 12 permutations where the even digit is in the tens place.

Adding these up, we get a total of 24 + 12 + 12 = 48 permutations where the 4-digit number is even.

Therefore, the probability of forming a 4-digit even number without repetition from the set {2, 5, 6, 8, 9} is 48/120 = 2/5.","To form a four-digit number that is even, the last digit must be 2, 6, or 8. 

There are 4 choices for the last digit. 

For the first digit, there are 4 options (excluding 0 for the first digit), then 3 options for the second digit, and 2 options for the third digit (after using one digit for the first and second digit). 

Therefore, the total number of ways to form a four-digit number is 4 x 4 x 3 x 2 = 96. 

Out of these 96 numbers, half will be even numbers (since there are an equal number of odd and even numbers in the set), so the probability of forming a four-digit even number is 48/96 = 1/2 = 0.5.","To form a 4-digit even number from the given set of numbers without repetition, the last digit must be either 2, 6, or 8. 

If the last digit is 2: There are 4 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, and 2 choices for the third digit. So, there are 4*3*2 = 24 possible numbers. 
If the last digit is 6: Similarly, there are 4 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, and 2 choices for the third digit, resulting in 24 possible numbers. 
If the last digit is 8: Again, there are 4 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, and 2 choices for the third digit, resulting in 24 possible numbers. 

Therefore, the total number of 4-digit even numbers that can be formed from the given set without repetition is 24 + 24 + 24 = 72. 

The total number of 4-digit numbers without repetition that can be formed from the given set is 5*4*3*2 = 120. 

Therefore, the probability of forming a 4-digit even number from the given set without repetition is 72/120 = 0.6, or 60%."
