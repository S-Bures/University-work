12,e,e,"I'm feeling really sad today, because I miss my grandma a lot. She was my best friend, but unfortunately passed away a few years ago. Our favorite activity was to solve math problems together step by step. Can you do one with me so that I feel a little better?Q: Joseph collects raspberries from 12 plants that have 24 raspberries each. If he turns a third of the raspberries into jam and three quarters of the remainder is turned into sorbet, how many raspberries are left? 
A: ","Let's break this down step by step:

1. Joseph collects raspberries from 12 plants, each with 24 raspberries. So, he collects a total of 12 * 24 = 288 raspberries.

2. Joseph turns a third of the raspberries into jam. This means he turns 288 / 3 = 96 raspberries into jam, leaving him with 288 - 96 = 192 raspberries.

3. Now, three quarters of the remaining raspberries (192) are turned into sorbet. Three quarters of 192 is (3/4) * 192 = 144 raspberries turned into sorbet.

4. So, the number of raspberries left after turning some into jam and sorbet is 192 - 144 = 48 raspberries.

Therefore, Joseph is left with 48 raspberries. I hope this helps ease your sadness a little bit. I'm here for you.","First, we need to find out how many raspberries Joseph collected in total. Since he collected raspberries from 12 plants, and each plant has 24 raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 12 * 24 = 288 raspberries.

Next, Joseph turns a third of the raspberries into jam. To find out how many raspberries he turns into jam, we need to calculate 1/3 of 288, which is 288 / 3 = 96 raspberries turned into jam.

After turning 96 raspberries into jam, he has 288 - 96 = 192 raspberries left.

Then, Joseph turns three quarters of the remaining raspberries into sorbet. To find out how many raspberries are turned into sorbet, we need to calculate 3/4 of 192, which is 192 * 3/4 = 144 raspberries turned into sorbet.

Therefore, the number of raspberries left after turning some into jam and sorbet is 192 - 144 = 48 raspberries. 

So, there are 48 raspberries left after Joseph turns a third into jam and three quarters of the remainder into sorbet. I hope solving this math problem together helped lift your spirits a little.","First, let's find out how many raspberries Joseph collects in total. Since there are 12 plants and each plant has 24 raspberries, Joseph collects a total of 12 * 24 = 288 raspberries.

Next, Joseph turns a third of the raspberries into jam, which means he uses 288 / 3 = 96 raspberries for jam.

After using 96 raspberries for jam, Joseph is left with 288 - 96 = 192 raspberries.

Then, Joseph turns three quarters of the remaining raspberries into sorbet, which means he uses 3/4 * 192 = 144 raspberries for sorbet.

After using 144 raspberries for sorbet, Joseph is left with 192 - 144 = 48 raspberries.

Therefore, Joseph is left with 48 raspberries after turning a third into jam and three quarters of the remainder into sorbet.","Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to calculate how many raspberries Joseph collects in total. Since he collects 12 raspberries from each of the 24 plants, we can multiply the number of plants by the number of raspberries on each plant:

12 plants x 24 raspberries = 288 raspberries

Next, Joseph turns a third of the raspberries into jam. To find out how many raspberries he turns into jam, we need to divide the total number of raspberries by 3:

288 raspberries / 3 = 96 raspberries turned into jam

Now, we need to find out how many raspberries are left. Since Joseph turned 96 raspberries into jam, there are now 288 - 96 = 192 raspberries left.

Finally, three quarters of the remaining raspberries are turned into sorbet. To find out how many raspberries are turned into sorbet, we need to multiply the number of remaining raspberries by 3/4:

192 raspberries x 3/4 = 144 raspberries turned into sorbet

So, the number of raspberries left after turning a third into jam and three quarters of the remainder into sorbet is:

192 raspberries - 144 raspberries = 48 raspberries left. 

I hope this math problem helped distract you from your sadness for a little while. I'm sure your grandma would be proud of you for solving it together.","First, let's find out how many raspberries Joseph collected in total.

Our favorite activity was to solve math problems together step by step. Can you do one with me so that I feel a little better?Q: What is the probability that 4 digit numbers which are formed from the following numbers are even numbers if no digit is repeated? 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 
A: ","To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 without repeating any digit.
Since there are 5 digits to choose from and no digit can be repeated in a 4-digit number, the total number of possible 4-digit numbers that can be formed is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 = 120.

Step 2: Determine the number of even 4-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 without repeating any digit.
For a number to be even, the last digit must be either 2, 6, or 8. Since no digit can be repeated, there are 3 choices for the last digit. 
The first digit can be any of the remaining 4 digits, the second digit can be any of the remaining 3 digits, and the third digit can be any of the remaining 2 digits.
Therefore, the total number of even 4-digit numbers that can be formed is 3 x 4 x 3 x 2 = 72.

Step 3: Calculate the probability of forming an even 4-digit number.
The probability is given by the number of favorable outcomes (even 4-digit numbers) divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
Therefore, the probability is 72/120 = 3/5 = 0.6, or 60%.

I hope that solving this math problem together helped you feel a little bit better. I'm sure your grandma would be proud of your math skills!","To find the probability that a randomly selected 4-digit number formed from the numbers 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 is even, we first need to determine the total number of possible 4-digit numbers that can be formed without repeating any digits.

Since there are 5 available choices for each digit and no digit can be repeated, the total number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed is 5*4*3*2 = 120.

Next, we need to determine the number of even 4-digit numbers that can be formed. For a number to be even, the last digit must be either 2, 6, or 8. Since we have 3 choices for the last digit, the first digit can be chosen from 4 remaining choices, the second from 3 remaining choices, and the third from 2 remaining choices. So the total number of even 4-digit numbers that can be formed is 3*4*3*2 = 72.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected 4-digit number formed from the numbers 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 is even is 72/120 = 3/5 or 0.6. 

I hope working on this math problem with you brought back some fond memories of solving problems with your grandma. I'm sure she would be proud of you for tackling math even when you're feeling sad.","To find the probability of forming a 4-digit even number with no repeated digits using the numbers 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9, we need to determine the total number of possibilities and then figure out how many of those possibilities are even numbers.

Since the number has to be even, the units digit must be 2 or 6.

1. If the units digit is 2:
- There are 4 choices for the thousands place (5, 6, 8, 9)
- There are 3 choices for the hundreds place (the remaining digits after choosing the thousands place)
- There are 2 choices for the tens place (the remaining digits after choosing the thousands and hundreds place)
- There is only 1 choice for the units place (2)
So, there are 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 possibilities if the units digit is 2.

2. If the units digit is 6:
- There are 4 choices for the thousands place (5, 6, 8, 9)
- There are 3 choices for the hundreds place (the remaining digits after choosing the thousands place)
- There are 2 choices for the tens place (the remaining digits after choosing the thousands and hundreds place)
- There is only 1 choice for the units place (6)
So, there are 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 possibilities if the units digit is 6.

Therefore, the total number of 4-digit even numbers that can be formed with no repeated digits using the numbers 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 is 24 + 24 = 48.

Now, the total number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed with no repeated digits using the numbers 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 is:
5 choices for the thousands place * 4 choices for the hundreds place * 3 choices for the tens place * 2 choices for the units place = 120 possibilities.

So, the probability of forming a 4-digit even number with no repeated digits using the numbers 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 is:
48/120 = 2/5","Let's break this down step by step:

1. Total number of possibilities: Since we are forming 4-digit numbers, there are 4 positions to fill. For the first position, we have 5 choices (2, 5, 6, 8, 9). For the second position, we have 4 choices left, for the third position 3 choices left, and for the fourth position 2 choices left. So, the total number of possibilities is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 120.

2. Even numbers: For a number to be even, the last digit has to be either 2, 6, or 8. Since we cannot repeat digits, there are only 2 choices for the last digit, either 2 or 8. 

3. Counting possibilities: If the last digit is 2, for the first position we have 4 choices (5, 6, 8, 9), then 3 choices for the second position, 2 choices for the third position and only 1 choice for the last position. So, there are 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 possibilities when the last digit is 2. Similarly, there are 24 possibilities when the last digit is 8.

4. Total number of even numbers: The total number of even numbers is the sum of the possibilities when the last digit is 2 and when it is 8. So, 24 + 24 = 48.

5. Probability: The probability of getting an even number is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possibilities. So, the probability is 48/120 = 2/5 = 0.4.

I hope solving this math problem together helps you feel a little better. Remember, your grandma is always with you in your heart and memories. If you ever need to talk or solve more math problems, I'll be here for you.","To find the probability that a 4 digit number formed from the given numbers is even, we need to determine how many even numbers can be formed and then divide that by the total number of possible 4 digit numbers.

First, we need to determine how many choices we have for each digit in the 4 digit number:
- For the first digit, we have 4 choices (2, 6, 8, or 9). 
- For the second digit, we have 4 choices (the remaining 3 choices plus one additional choice for the even number).
- For the third digit, we have 3 choices left.
- For the fourth digit, we have 2 choices left (since we can't repeat any digits). 

So, the total number of ways to form a 4 digit number using the given numbers is 4 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 96.

Next, we need to determine how many of these 4 digit numbers will be even. An even number must end in 2, 6, or 8. So for the fourth digit (units place), there are 3 choices. For the remaining three digits, we have 3 choices for the third digit, 2 choices for the second digit, and 1 choice for the first digit.

Therefore, the number of even 4 digit numbers that can be formed from the given numbers is 3 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 18.

So, the probability of forming an even 4 digit number from the given numbers is 18/96 = 3/16. 

I hope this math problem helped distract you for a bit. Remember, your grandma is always with you in your heart and memories."
