2. 	No one should follow any gun laws. 2A's purpose is to have sufficient weaponry to overthrow the government if it becomes tyrannical. We should have full autos along with drones, WMDs, everything.  With exceptions like Trump, the government taxes us and can't perform its most essential function which is protecting our borders, so they are stealing our money. And here we are talking about extended clips. We lost our rights a long time ago starting with the 1933 gun ban. Maybe earlier.
3. 		Considering that at the time when the Second Amendment was written, civilians had the exact same weapons as the military.   So you are 100% correct in your reasoning.
4. 			If everybody had muskets and cannons, elected officials would be forced to do their job or they'd be swiftly removed. Ocasio-Cortez, a full blown Communist was just elected a U.S. Representative. In her interview with Jake Tapper she couldn't account for $38 trillion of a $40 trillion 10 year spending plan. She wants-  - Federal housing  - 'Free' college  - Medicare for all  - Debt **forgiveness**  Why does she want all this? Because the majority of taxes throughout the entire Western world are paid by white men and she is Puerto Rican representing other Puerto Ricans. 
5. 				Question, what good is free college if you have free housing, food, medical, etc? Why bother to learn anything or better yourself when you can just fuck off and play video games all day and still have everything you'd ordinarily have to work for?

","1. I don't particularly like commenting on here because I'm a lurker and not a huge fan of GG, but I want to set the record straight on this.  Brad Wardell's politics have been known for a long time, and if people were review bombing him over that, the would have done the same thing to GalCiv 3, which they have not.  Stardock is in the middle of suing the original developers of Star Control to prevent them from releasing a true sequel to Star Control 2 (which any reasonable read of all the stupid contract muck surrounding this whole thing indicates that they have every right to do).  This is after saying on multiple occasions while they were developing Origins that they were ""staying out of the original Star Control universe so that hopefully Fred & Paul (the original devs) can make a true sequel some day"" or something to that effect.  A lot of us Star Control fans were really excited that Stardock was going to be making a Star Control game, and we were *doubly* excited when Fred & Paul announced they were going to make a true sequel.  At this point now (contrary to what Brad and his cronies are claiming), Fred & Paul can't realistically even *start* working on their true sequel because they've got this lawsuit hanging over their head, and the settlement offer from Stardock says outright that they're literally never allowed to make another Star Control game again as long as they live.  If Star Control: Origins is being review bombed, I can essentially guarantee you that that's the reason.  The vast majority of the fan community would like to see both Star Control games, and many of us decided not to purchase Origins *specifically because of this ridiculous lawsuit*.
2. 	Yeah, it's like he's trying to burn down the Star Control community so he can have a piece of paper saying he owns the ashes, all while claiming to be a true old-school SC fan. So strange. I can't say I have a great opinion of Brad after this.
3. 		You can't present the situation without bringing up the fact that *he actually made a Star Control game and it's good* which is something you can't say about Paul and Fred over the past quarter century. It's easy to make Stardock look like the party poopers if you leave out the little irrelevant detail that they just revived the IP. 
4. 			>he actually made a Star Control game and it's good  According to the reviews, it isn't.
5. 				According to the Steam reviews and Metacritic professional reviews, it is.    So you know, right off the bat you're being misleading.  The Metacritic user reviews are merely mediocre, and they are full of 0 point scores saying ""It is utter trash F U"" without any useful commentary.   Hence the existence of this fucking thread in the first place., because it looks like a review bomb is going on. 
6. 					And as others have pointed out ITT, there are plenty of reviews that don't appear to be ""review bombs"" pointing out that the game has flaws.  Sorry that you and Wardell both seem to think his game should be free of criticism and that anyone doing so is part of some sinister conspiracy.
7. 						>And as others have pointed out ITT, there are plenty of reviews that don't appear to be ""review bombs"" pointing out that the game has flaws.  Yes, there are, and if you leave the legitimate negative reviews in, and only peel out the obviously deceptive ""It's nothing like Star Control 0/10"" ones, you get *the same fucking mid-70's score as the game has everywhere else*, which is what I'm saying to you.  And what Brad was saying too for that matter.   >Sorry that you and Wardell both seem to think his game should be free of criticism  Sorry you can't read high school English. 
8. 							So, what you're saying is...according to the reviews, the game isn't good?  Thanks for proving my point, champ.  Got anything else you want to try?  I'll give you another shot at redeeming yourself.
9. 								No; I'm saying the things that I'm saying. Anybody else who reads this exchange will see what I mean and also see that you're being a pedantic little twat, so what's the point in me saying the same things over again when there's nobody reasonable to say them to?
10. 									What a waste of an opportunity to redeem yourself.  Not even worthy of a ""You Tried/10"".

","1. What I don't understand about this is how can certain publishers legally operate in the US when they localize explicitly loli content?  MangaGamer has released several visual novels with clearly underage characters in sexual situations (uncensored I might add) and they have no issue selling those products in the red states.  In fact, one of the few times they actually censored something was bestiality-related as that's apparently riskier to bring over, and this was in a VN that had loli incest completely intact. 
2. 	The same way people can openly sell pot in California despite it being a blatant violation of federal law: there's only so much time in the day, and so many prosecutors, so not everyone gets prosecuted.
3. 		Huh, could have swore pot wasn't illegal on a federal level anymore and it's just that most states still have it on the books.  I figured it was like fireworks, where they're illegal to own in my state, but you can just buy them in the next state over.  That being said, I think there's a difference between selling locally and adhering to those local laws and selling country-wide both digitally and physically.  And correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't places that sell pot in California smaller places and not these big conglomerates? Not that niche publishers are big conglomerates either, but they're still paying federal taxes and get more spread out coverage for their products.
4. 			> Huh, could have swore pot wasn't illegal on a federal level anymore and it's just that most states still have it on the books.   Marijuana is still regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. Chuck Schumer introduced a bill earlier this year to decriminalize it and it went nowhere.  > That being said, I think there's a difference between selling locally and adhering to those local laws and selling country-wide both digitally and physically.  Establishing personal jurisdiction has always been the big problem with obscenity cases on the Internet: some retard in Buttfuck, Iowa will always insist that some shit you posted on a server in California was clearly directed at him and therefore Iowa law should prevail.   > And correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't places that sell pot in California smaller places and not these big conglomerates?  Why would that even matter? Should the law only afford protection to 'the little guy' (i.e. people you like)? That said, it's worth noting that most of the pot shops are run by libtards who are finding that, oddly enough, most people would rather continue buying from their local dealer who doesn't seem to mind tax evasion any more than they minded selling illegal substances.

No, I was just saying in actual application of the law, a nationally-known entity with an easily looked up headquarters would be easier to go after than some small store that isn't breaking any local laws and is thus out of the jurisdiction of anyone that would care.  Though I supposed by that logic, these companies can be operating in areas where it's 100% legal and since there aren't any actual federal laws in place, anyone going after them would similarly be out of their jurisdiction, so the best they can do is go after consumers in 100% illegal areas.

2. 	how do men want women to look?   emaciated and a push over!   So men can play being heroes to the damsels in distress   and really that's the only role men want to play  Men don't want women who dont look emaciated and a pushover, cos those kind of women frighten men   and how can men act out their role of being heroes if women don't need heroes?  How can men call themselves manly if women are as manly as men?  Certainly men don't want to call that being feminine, not when they don't recognise that might be part of being a man?  Women can build up their strength, their weight, their muscles and flex them just as much as any man.. yikes, men say, give her a miss boys, she isn't pandering to the likes of us men?  
3. 		> Women can build up their strength, their weight, their muscles and flex them just as much as any man..   No, no they can't. Biology has determined that women just aren't as large, as strong or as quick as men are. It's a fact of nature sweetie x
4. 			you do realise that most women in stone-age times had more muscle power than the average man today?  How come one asks?   because of the work they did that built up their muscles and their diet which was totally different then.   Cupcake you wouldn't haven't been a contest to them   and you know cupcake  men have twice the upper body strength of women,!   So for women to achieve the same goals as men in labour intensive jobs women have to work twice as hard as men to realise them and women do usually achieve them.   So if women work twice as hard as men in these jobs should women be paid twice as much for the extra effort they have to put in.?  Men say if women want to be regarded to equal to men, they must act like men!  Little point in being born female then is there?   Of course if women want to build up their own body strength they should be encouraged to because they do have the muscle and when women get over male brainwashing that tells them it isn't feminine and realise it's zero to do with being manly but everything to do with being womanly they probably will

Therefore, men receive from Allah twice as much as women. Husbands who are disobeyed by their wives can punish them, confine them to bed and even beat them. Women are the greatest calamity men received from Allah.”**  Quran, written by disciples of Mohammed, Arabia, circa 700 AD  lets disseminate it  ""we men have big fists, oh look we can beat women down with them.. ooh high5 me bro I got one cornered, who of us is going to be first in line to give her the first punch""  men are brave like that!  ----  that is how brave men really are!  ----

","1. I disagree with a fundamental premise of this article. The author seems to be under the impression that because gaming journalism is inherently shallow, it attracts people who are essentially well-meaning schlubs with no talent. He doesn't stop to consider that the quality may be shit because it's filled with people who are *malicious*; people who aren't just doing this because they like talking about stuff, but people who fucking hate the thing they cover and want to destroy it.  And I'm not sure why he thinks this. Is it because gaming publications are inherently aimed at hobbyists and would thus preclude any advancement into serious fields? If so, he should stop to consider that it isn't 2005; video games are not some thing you do in a basement somewhere. They're a multi-billion dollar industry and so the defense a small hobby has against social climbers is virtually gone. And that's not mentioning how becoming popular within a niche is a well known tactic; it's how the Paul brothers got rich, and Cardi B, and virtually every ""sensation"" since Justin Bieber. Why wouldn't opportunists be lurking around? Why *wouldn't* an industry bigger than movies have people willing to tank their own reputations to destroy it?  More to the point, it *is* possible to produce quality content we could describe as ""gaming journalism"". Yeah, rehashing press releases is stupid and non-productive, but there are people who conduct interviews with developers, mess around with hardware, report on the society and culture surrounding games, (in ways that aren't just polemics against consumers) conduct serious reviews of titles, etc, etc.  So I don't think ""game journalism sucks because it's just not possible for it not to suck"" is at all a valid stance to take; it's lazy and ignores the fact that gaming publications hire people who fucking hate video games. This naive view of games journalism still being issues of *Nintendo Power* and shit like ""Ctrl+Alt+Del"" is just flat-out wrong. If this guy was a political consultant, he'd be giving advice to candidates in 2018 on how to beat Dick Nixon, appeal to the Confederate war veterans in Georgia, and stick it to the USSR.
2. 	I think there are also very specific forces at work here, forces that cannot be simply explained as the interplay between markets and supply/demand dynamics, and those forces are probably best summed up as The Leftist San Fran Tech Bubble. The percentage of ideologically retarded gamer-hating journos who live in San Fransisco (or an equivalently ridiculous city) isn't just coincidence or correlation - it's legitimately the root cause of all this progressive idiocy in journalism. Creating good videogame journalism might be as easy as figuring out how to publish it somewhere other than a Leftist urban enclave on the coast.

Over the past few months, simply logging into the game has netted me millions of GTA bucks. They have double cash promos all the time and they have giveaways all the time that simply hand you money.  Now, if you wanted to invest time into the game and actually play it then you should have enough money by the end of doing everything to buy almost everything in the game. All the DLC is end game content. It's like buying an expansion pack with virtual currency. And once you have the CEO expansion with a garage (probably $2mil investment), you can do car heists to make money. This alone makes buying shark cards for someone who doesn't have time anymore super easy. In 15 min, you can quickly make $60,000-$80,000 and more if you collect a set of cars.  Shark cards are for two people: people who want to play that don't have time but want a fancy car to run with their friends OR people who think because a new car is out, they must buy it like some completionist autistic gamer.  All the things you buy in the game for the necessity to have fun are cheap. If you need the fancy stuff, play the game as intended or spend you money.  Back in subject though: Cheating should never get you any time in jail. And what stops in-game exploits from being considered cheating later if this doesn't get a nail in the coffin?
6. 		This happened with Sony as well in regards to PS3 hacking. When talking about all the possible things that are evil from an entertainment company (that we've seen to date anyway), this tops it.    I haven't bought a single Sony product since then and refuse to even pirate games that are only available on Sony platforms and play them on emulator. They deserve as little exposure and recognition, I'll be doing the same with Rockstar and Take-Two. 
7. 		This is a civil matter 100%. Sue them for recourse don't use  the cops and force to them get your pound of flesh.

","1. The only thing more tiresome than celebrities sharing their politics are people telling them to shut up.
2. 	How about this? You're an actor; not a philosopher. I don't need my trained acting monkeys to tell me how to fix the world and how evil I am. I need to them to pretend to be interesting for ninety minutes.
3. 		Would you object to an actor telling Anita Sarkesian or Hillary Clinton they're a proper cunt? What about a celebrity standing up for free speech or due process? I know I wouldn't complain. Therefore I'm not gonna be a hypocrite every time Meryl Streep wants to remind us orange man is bad. Sure I find it as annoying as you do, but no one is forcing me to follow those idiots on Twitter either.
4. 			>Would you object to an actor telling Anita Sarkesian or Hillary Clinton they're a proper cunt?  That's descriptive. What the Marvel actors are saying is prescriptive.  There's a world of difference.
5. 				And freedom of speech is freedom of speech. You want to criticize what they have to say? Chastise them for picking an inappropriate time/place? That's perfectly fine. Again, you lost me at ""shut up"".
6. 					Where did I say that? They have right to demand how we live our lives, and we have a right to call them twats for it.
7. 						So you're stroking your own dick over the distinction between descriptive/prescription just for my benefit? Thanks sweetheart.
8. 							Ah shucks, it's least I can do for someone being so wilfully obtuse! :)
9. 			I just wish these actors would express their opinions without insulting people. All these people really do is call Trump names and, on occasion, wish death on Trump supporters (Michael Shannon). Most of these actors sound incredibly hateful and angry, and I think that’s why people go “shut up and sing.”
10. 			There is a difference between the views someone shares on Twitter and those they share at Comic-Con, an event that is not their personal soapbox. I mean does guys fighting in tights have anything to do with politics? And is standing up for free speech really compare to calling Anita and Hillary that? No. That's a neutral statement, it doesn't directly insult anyone or any group.   I wouldn't praise any actor for saying something incendiary at Comic-Con. I would laugh, but I would call them an idiot for saying something like that at that event because it isn't the time nor place.
11. 				As long as they're not advocating violence/slander/libel, then I'll defend anyone's right to free speech, even if I find said speech repugnant or deem the venue inappropriate. Sure, I understand (and largely agree with) Hambly's sentiment. I just draw the line at ""shut up"". Sorry if that rustles anyone's jimmies. 
12. 	a lot of quarter pounder and suit wearing sargonites here, so yay for brigading here
13. 		...what? I don't get how you'd equate being fed up with self-aggrandising celebrities hijacking their platform to spew leftist soundbytes over the airwaves to being a Sargonite.  It's a weird reach, quite unlike how your post clearly shows you to be a faggot. 
14. 			Yeah, gotta say I'm not getting the Sargon or ""brigading"" reference here. Maybe it's the boomer in me?
15. 			it's a weird reach ? so whenever anyone offends fucking e- fame whores they are downvoted. ok newfag go back to 9gag

","1. These shameless people are just making things worse for women. Originally when #metoo first started I tried to explain to a guy friend that these things do happen to women, but soon after I stopped defending it. It clearly became a political tool, aimed at hurting others rather than defending/helping women.  Kavanaugh case was just ridiculous. I don't understand that people were so eager to jump on him and ruin his career. They traumatized this man and his family... for what? Not is it just that I didn't see any evidence, but watching Ford and her questionable body language made me even more suspicious. Why was she trying to ""act cute""? Either Democrats took advantage of a mentally disturbed woman or this was a politically plot. In any case, it's very unfair. As women though, we do see that leftists are just using us and we are walking away.
2. 	Kavanaugh has spoken of Roe v Wade as if it is still open.  To the supreme court it can be.  Feminists think he might challenge it and they wont have their right to kill babies taken away.  In their eyes, false accusations are proper political tools.
3. 		That's a good point, I figured any conservative on Supreme Court would be against their wishes, but this makes even more sense 
4. 			Yeah.  The timing instantly made me think it was a political by nature.  I recently (trial finished in August) had my family nearly torn apart by a sexual assault case between two minors one being a close relative of my wife's and the other being a close relative of mine.  We were forced to be smack dab in the middle of the whole thing.  It was dismissed with great prejudice, but I know first hand the destructive force of these types of accusations.  My wife and I were newlywed and expecting our now 10 month old daughter when the charges were first brought up.  Even still the effects are felt.  Some aspects of my family will never, ever be the same.  I get pretty mad at blatantly false accusations.  
5. 				That's horrible, sorry to hear about that :( It's always tough when there's legal proceedings within the family. Hope things will get better!  I think a lot of female supporters of #metoo movement and feminism just follow the emotional reaction thinking those people speak for women's interests. However, intimidation and accusations are not the right way to bring change. All they do is create resistance and turn both sides against each other. Men are not going to be more respectful because they're scared, that stems from personal values. They're going to be more bitter and see women as a liability.  It's hard to discuss these topics nowadays, especially online, but I try to get people to think beyond their initial feelings.

","1. Meh. Political bullshit. Macron's party is happy to light counterfires to avoid talking about the hot topics right now, and Melenchon is a self-centered clown pretending to care for the masses who just happened to make a gigantic ass out of himself even more so than usual.  Don't get me wrong, I voted for Macron, but he has stuff to fix before I'm happy I did it. This is not helpful.
2. 	> I voted for Macron  I wish for you to be cursed, everywhere you will go, light will cease to work and you will be left out in the dark, stumbling your pinky toes on heavy wooden furniture until your last breath.  Peut être que la prochaine fois tu te fera pas retourner la tête par la véritable propagande, les castors qui tout les cinq années font ""barrage"". 
3. 		By ""barrage"", I take it you're reffering to the second turn, where everybody voted against Le pen, rather than for Macron ?  Wrong call. I voted for the other guy because I believe her ideas are uninteresting, when his had.. very slight potential, not because of ""making a barrage"". Even if I deem the FN ideas (or should I call it the RN now ?) completely bonkers, I support their right for speech, especially as demonizing them is the best way to bring them support. Let those ideas be discussed on the marketplace of thought and voted upon.
4. 			>Wrong call. I voted for the other guy because I believe her ideas are uninteresting, when his had.. very slight potential  Like the idea of making one of the very, very few socialist system that work in a ultra capitalistic environment like his genious idea of :  - privatizing social security  - public transport  - Destroying the CDI (Contras à Durée Indéterminé) , now your will have a contract for the duration you are needed, after that you return to unemployment state, meaning you **will** lower your standards just to be able to work, good luck having a family when you don't know when and where you will work 6 months in advance.   - Being another lapdog for the Americans like Hollande/Sarkozy, Chirac told the Americans to fuck off ""looking for mass destruction weapons"" in Iraq, t'was a good thing indeed, for 8 years it was more ""Obama said : Baguette, you go there and you do this, yes sir!""   > her ideas are uninteresting  - Close the borders.  - Negociate with ""mommy"" Merkel a better deal, since we switched to € we French **lost** a fuckton of ""purchasing power"" especialy after the Greek fiasco and allowing pretty much anyone and everyone in Europe   - Revoke citizenship to people leaving the country to do the jihad in kebabistan  - Allow anything to be voted by a referendum on a national scale wise if 300,000 people sign the request.  - Revoke social aid to people being send to prison and the family of said person too if it's an aggravated crime.  - Stop the military interventionism madness (reminder that even if people like to slanders our military as surrending faggot, France have boots on ground in 17 countries up to this day, *officialy*) **or** if you wish to continue, give an appropriate budget to be able to have boots on ground in 17 countries on the nano budget we have/had (daily reminder France is the only European country that respect it's pledge to the 2.3% of GDP spend on it's Defence program in the N.A.T.O accords, when GB is at 1.8% of it's GDP and Germany at 1.2%)   I guess that uninteresting compared to a guy that clearly said he will ""ubber-ise"" the country.

","1. I don't know why society has such a blind spot here:  That guy stole something from me -- Prove it  That guy killed someone -- Prove it  That guy beat up some dude -- Prove it   That guy raped that girl -- Save the girl! Demonize the man!
2. 	I’m not British, but historically for women it’s much more like... That guy raped that girl-  you horrible, evil slut.  Get out of this house now and figure out how to make it in the world.  No skills?  No husband will have you because you’re socially labeled a whore?  Enjoy your life as a street prostitute.  God forbid you got pregnant from a rape.  It was just 10 times worse. Historically women have always had to bear the brunt of sexual and domestic violence in silence and little or no protection.   I fully get it that women to level false rape charges are despicaple.  Those women should face severe charges for that. They should reap what they sow.  You can’t use the law as a weapon and file false charges. I also agree that women who engage in wiling sexual behavior after drinking and regret it is very differ than predatory behavior when a woman in plied with alcohol or slipped drugs.   The thing is we, as a society need to stop viewing people as a commodity to sold, fucked, traded, used, whatever.  We are human. And until we can see that in each other the worst of humanity will probably win out 
3. 		“Historically” , meaning it used to be a thing. And not just some time ago, a LONG time ago. That kind of thing happened everywhere. It’s not specific to Britain. Yes it’s bad. Yes we all know it happened. Saying that “it’s worse today than it ever was” and there is a “rape culture” is just straight out factually incorrect and dumb 
4. 			And historically I mean it happened up until about the 1960s.  Certainly hundreds of years before that but let’s not pretend that unwed mothers homes and social pariahs based on premarital sex was a thing of the dark ages.  Women’s didn’t really gain their sexual freedom until the BCP. Then they could say I’ll sleep with you, but I’m not going to marry you and I’m not going to have your kid. Sexual revolution. 
5. 			What people mean by “rape culture” is that societally we set up barriers for victims of rape (both sexes) to prevent them from reporting it. Or we treat it as a non-crime. When I’m sitting at my job completing my state mandated safety training (everything from using a vpn to secured areas) and one of the topics is legitimately about protecting myself from rapists by watching my alcohol consumption that is rape culture.  My job has nothing to do with alcohol consumption or sexual violence. It’s a little tsk tsk to me about my behavior that is none of my employers business and how they believe I should act.  Second, I don’t recall any other tips being given out like don’t go walking alone in the middle of the night in the crappy part of town if you don’t want to get murdered. The point is that when it comes to rape, time and time again the onus is put on the victim to avoid rape and not on the perpetrator to not commit rape or to face the consequences for committing rape. A robbery doesn’t happen if a robber isn’t present and willingly committing a crime. A murder isn’t happening if a murderer isn’t present and committing a crime. A rape is t happening unless a rapist is present a committing a crime.  We think of things like country music as being fairly sweet, innocent, and encompassing American values.  My husband likes this song called Everclear and I fucking hate it. In the song the man sings gleefully about being In love with a particular girl so he slips Everclear in her drink to make her easy.  But she passed out so he just left her laying on her front lawn.  Everything about that screams rape.  He did not have consent in anyway. Singing about and making money off it and saying it’s just a song...that’s rape culture.  It values those things over what real human beings experience every single day.   Those are just anecdotes but if you’re going to say there isn’t a rape culture show me how that is possible when we live in a world where we treat each other as commodities. 
6. 				Maybe in that rape is actually illegal? A chargeable offence with a hefty amount of jail time but no, it's COMPLETELY socially acceptable you say.  Your also completely ignoring that rapists don't care if rape is illegal or not, fucking hell everyone knows it's wrong if they haven't been living underneath a rock for the last 20 years.  This is paramount to someone trying to rape you and you telling them mid act it's against the law. You can't control the aggressor in this scenario, you can only help the potential victims take counter measures, like not drinking alcohol, fucking hell your companies trying to help you avoid it.  It continues to baffle me that people say we live in a rape culture, when the west can almost be considered to be the anti-thesis of it, men's lives thrown away over a baseless accusation. 
7. 				Ok? And Carrie Underwood and Kelly Clarkson both got famous with songs about trashing their ex bf’s belongings because they’re mad.  If we’re basing off of pop songs you’re in for a bad time.

2. 	Will probably be worse. This is guy is LUCKY he was filming. The daughter seems just like the type to attack him, get beaten in self-defense, then cry ""assault"" when the cops show up.  This is the type of shit that makes me want put cameras inside my car. Not because everyday driving is dangerous, but for that one time it's gonna be my word vs theirs and the cops think I am too male and too black to be believed.
3. 		Hey man you should have a dash cam anyway. Any accidents you have, the claim will be a lot easier with video proof. Just get one! Could save ya.
4. 			Dash cams are too cheap to not have one! I have one in each of my cars, one has two cameras, one for the front and one for the rear. Less than $130, cheaper than a lawyer for 5 minutes 
5. 				It took me awhile to convince my wife we should get one, and I still haven't had the ""Gotcha you son of a bitch"" moment I was wanting so everytime we get in the car I hear a snide ""waste of money"" remark. But when it happens... oh the sweet sweet feeling of justice.
6. 					This perfectly describes the foundation of my marriage.  
7. 					LOL..  I feel ya brother!  
8. 					1. I've had SD card that got corrupted. Luckily, there was notification on camera screen that it can't record. Solved by replacing SD card. 2. My dash cam was 5yo and internal battery didn't hold the charge as it supposed to. So when I've got into accident car shut off and video file became corrupted. I couldn't recover incident video.  Since then I bought a new camera, wired it directly to battery so that it works all the time, not only when ignition is on.
9. 			I have one, about to put a second on the back windshield. I just recorded a guy run a red light today almost clipping two vehicles. And then yesterday some guy made a left forcing me to slam my breaks. 
10. 		Speaking as a white guy, if I was black I'd keep a body cam on me at all times.  Getting up to go pee in the middle of the night, better strap on the camera.  Can't be too careful.
11. 		That last part is too real. There's been multiple times where cops have stopped me and one of my roommates because ""they fit the description"" and didn't believe a word of their alibi until I confirmed it. And they don't even ask questions when I confirm it. Like fuck, if the description is ""tall African American male"" why are you stopping a guy who is shorter than me? I'm 5'8"". And why the fuck do you not believe a word he says and then don't even ask questions once I get involved?
12. 			Most people that get arrested for petty crimes spend months in jail and have their lives ruined, or plead guilty to bullshit crimes and trumped up charges to avoid a long prison sentence
13. 			With 29,000,000,000+ unsolved crimes in the US, every single person, including every newborn and old lady in a nursing home, ''fits the description'' at this point.

He claims to have re-written every sentence is his first look like 8 times; bullshit. He thinks asking someone if they believe in Christ’s resurrection is more offensive them asking them about what they “do in bed”. His meat-only diet, while technically fine, is extreme and oddly symbolic. And he’s clearly an angry dude — conspicuously intense even in chill settings. I used to love the guy. I have his book. I’ve gone to see him speak. He’s a bad character, who says some otherwise good stuff. But he is bad news.

Because the CBC told me he is a racist nazi bigot jew lover who wouldn't let the transpipo in his class even LIVE or EXIST...  *face palm*  Thanks for saving me
9. 							2 reasons is easy:  1) He calls out post moderism and cultural Marxism as bullshit and something dangerous  2) He speaks up about personal responsibility and individualism  How's he going to betray that.  He's been teaching this for over 20 years.  You're an ignorant fool, or a troll.  Either way here's my advice :  Go clean your room 
10. 					So he's bad because he's hyperbolic and neurotic? I don't follow him very closely, but appreciated his talks on communism and biology. The fact that he isn't fringe is probably positive, since he can repackage some of the more controversial ideas for a laymen audience. For example, he's done IQ and dipped his toes into race.

The people that work with this are working with people who are beaten, raped, and stabbed, or families of murder victims.  I think it is a bit of an insult to them to have to take her seriously. 
4. 			Interesting system, what are your thoughts on it.  Does it work? Or is it, how I imagine it, rife with bogus claims?  Im from Canada which has pretty much the same old system like the US, and things can take a decade to go through the courts until a verdict is finally met.  Are things done quicker down in OZ?  Id love to see your country one day,  but the huge spiders and insane heat will keep me away for the time being.  I was in South Korea in August for 3 weeks and just about died from the heat so I imagine OZ would be even worse.  Cheers mate.

","1. The amusing thing is that they put her in as a ""Fuck men!"" move, yet men are more likely to play as her due to sex appeal. 
2. 	I don't think men are more likely to play a female character, much less due to ""sex appeal.""  Games aren't about sex. It's basically the opposite, the more you game the less you will have sex.  Female action movies/games are by definition *camp.*  Having a male character in an action/fighting game is far more immersive.
3. 		The whole ""gamers don't have sex"" thing was a worn out stereotype 20 years ago. Even if it were true not having sex wouldn't mean that you are uninterested in sex so sex appeal would still be a thing that could influence your preferences.  &#x200B;  Action movies in general are pretty fucking camp to varying degrees. One badass goes around being some immortal god of destruction. Is Bayonetta campier than Devil May Cry though? Would Kill Bill have been less campy with a male lead? Was Aliens more campy than Commando? I think there are times an action movie putting a woman in a particular role doing some things can make it campier but just being like ""oh women action movies are so much campier than men action movies"" is retarded.
4. 			> Bayonetta campier than Devil May Cry  They're both very camp.    > Would Kill Bill have been less campy with a male lead?  Slightly.  Camp isn't really a problem either.  I like Bloodborne, which I put in the camp category.  I still play as a man, but a woman fits that setting equally well.  >""oh women action movies are so much campier than men action movies"" is retarded.  Yeah, no it's not.  It's always going to be an extra layer of camp.  No one said that games with male leads can't be camp, but a female action hero is ALWAYS camp. Sorry, buddy.

3. 		That's why you can't trust ~~mainstream media~~ The Daily Prophet to tell the truth and have to turn to the conspiracy theorist ~~Alex Jones~~ Xenophillius Lovegood to get the real truth. In the mean time, don't forget to bring your ~~assault rifle~~ wand that everyone carries in school to the ~~anti-government militia shooting range~~ Dumbledore's Army training session. We need to be able to fight back against the ~~feminist~~ crazy cat lady that has turned the education system into an authoritarian indoctrination center.   I don't understand their obsession with Harry Potter.   edit: mixed up Rita Skeeter with Xenophillius Lovegood
4. 			Rita Skeeter is the very definition of hack writing and unethical journalism. You're thinking about Xenophilius Lovegood and his tabloid The Quibbler, which is the only publication willing to publish Harry's side when the government is in denial of Voldemort's return.
5. 				You are right. Rita Skeeter is A.J. Daulerio. Fixed.
6. 			>I don't understand their obsession with Harry Potter.  Harry Potter books were intended for children/teens. These people are emotionally/mentally children.  I'm not discrediting the book series, mind you. If you like them, that's cool. I'm just saying this why SJWs are obsessed with them.
7. 				From what I’ve seen it’s the female nerd equivalent of nerdy guys liking Star Wars.  It’s ubiquitous to the point it’s almost a cliche for someone to say either is their favourite movie/book series (And more specifically to say The Empire Strikes Back or Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one in the series).

2. 	My mother in law worked at The Foundling Hospital here in NYC and she saw a child whose mother admitted that she intentionally sat him in acid as a baby (resulting in the child having his genitals destroyed and being in agonizing pain every time he had to use the bathroom for the rest of his life) be EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO THE MOTHER.  So you know she’s a complete waste of life when a woman loses custody. You pretty much have to get caught red-handed simultaneously filming and distributing child porn of your child while also doing heroin while also beating them with an object (just a hand won’t be enough) while also raping a police officer. And even then they will just send a CPS agent to ask questions. So for a woman to actually lose custody to the father, you know she’s about the worst person on the planet. 
3. 		This makes me fucking sick and so pissed off.  Our 3mo old died from SIDS. We had cannabis in the home at the time of his death. They searched our house for close to, if not over, ten hours. They took my grandmothers ashes that were in a pill bottle (whole other story - aunt is a pillhead) because they thought it was coke?? Bone fragments visible in it and everything. Then the 10month CPS case ensued. They took our oldest and placed him with my parents for 2 weeks until we tested clean. They tested our son twice for cannabis because he was exclusively breastfed, we didn't get his ashes back for about 2months after his death. They tried to put my husband and I in drug court. They denied us. Wanted us to go to a drug rehab center twice a week. Classes were separated by gender. This meant we would have had to go 4 times a week on top of my husband working full time, at the time. We're 30 minutes away from any towns. We demanded someone come to our house if they wanted us to do all that crap. So then we went through about 6 different counselors who came to our house every single week. He passed February 2015 and our case was not closed until December 2015. All because of cannabis. Such bullshit. 
4. 			Yep. Cannabis is the middle of nowhere (and even city) police departments’ bread and butter. Under current federal legislation it is permissible for departments to seize assets whenever they have “reasonable suspicion” that the suspect has been distributing “narcotics”. They DO NOT HAVE TO PROVE THIS IN COURT. THE SUSPECT CAN BE CLEARED OF ALL CHARGES AND THEY CAN KEEP THEIR SEIZED MONEY AND PROPERTY. Up to 90% of assets seized can be kept by the seizing local authorities, with the remainder being handed up the food chain to the feds.     The reason given is that it strangles cartels by cutting off their resources. Can they explain seizing a couple’s home because their son was accused of selling small quantities of drugs? Pretty sure these otherwise unblemished citizens are not secretly El Chapo. SERIOUSLY GOOGLE IT.     Here’s where marijuana comes in. Because of the PROVEN fact that marijuana does not have physically addictive properties, causes no craving or withdrawal beyond that which would be experienced by someone if you took their television away, it is a substance that you have a decent chance of finding at any given stop and search. Every kind of person in this country smokes weed. The CEOs, the preachers, the moms, the saints, the sinners. It has zero impact on a normal healthy person’s ability to function and live a normal, successful life. Its “addictive” properties are like those of sex or food, it’s only addictive to someone who has problems with emotions, self control, and/or discipline. Most humans can pick it up and put it down as they please, and those who can’t would have found something to have a problem with anyway. Leaving marijuana as a schedule 1 narcotic and continuing the charade of pretending to believe that it “kills kids” is what keeps local law enforcement in business in Bumblescum, NowhereState. Unlike the NYPD where they have plenty of tax dollars rolling in per capita and they just use marijuana statutes to intimidate and harass an overwhelmingly poor and marginalized sector of the city, there is not enough actual crime to sustain their justifications for keeping a force at all, let alone a force as large as they do have, and there is no money in taking down actual criminals (like rapists). So what is a corrupt police/sheriff’s department to do?    You are a victim of the continuing playacting where law enforcement and other institutions pretend that they genuinely believe that marijuana is “a dangerous drug”.    Everyone I have spoken to in healthcare understands that the health risks come from smoking via combustion methods and have the same risks as smoking cigarettes, except without a proven addictive substance involved that causes clinically documented physical craving and withdrawal. Additionally, the several contacts I have in law enforcement are extremely aware that marijuana is a relatively benign substance that is used as a tool against poor and dark people.    Read the description of the first hearing to make marijuana illegal. They have a direct quote of an argument used to justify the legislation that I will paraphrase here: “.. you give a Mexican in the field a puff of a marijuana cigarette and he thinks he’s a bullfighter in Toledo”. More racism and classism. On the federal level, they claimed to have “isolated the active ingredient “ and injected it into dogs’ brains, a couple of which died. THC was not isolated and identified until WWII or possibly just after. This “study” was “performed” many years before this discovery.        An educated population is the only cure, but I doubt it will happen in my lifetime.

3. 		The last time I saw Roger was last year at the Boxing Day Test. He’d turned into such a fat, normal yobbo cunt.  ""The wife nearly didn’t let me out today,"" he said.  And he did all that chanting yobs do, like; ""Ooh, ahh, Glenn McGrath"".  It got you in the end, I thought to myself as I looked at Roger. Life got you in the end, pal. You were such a cocky successful winner when we were sixteen, But now you’re just another sad, fat prick sitting in the MCG high-fiving in self-congratulation, as if it’s *you* that had the skill and determination to play for Australia.  It’s the cunts with the bad haircuts that you’ve got to watch out for. There’s never been a popular teenager yet who’s done rats with their life. It’s the fucking dorks that give it a real go.  Glenn McGrath got 5 for 50 that day.
4. 			""I've never been a fan of Internet Explorer""  Crowd laughs nervously and a few grunts are heard from the back seats as people edge closer to hear the punchline.  ""Why not? Don't you like the internet?""  The crowd suddenly stands up, aware that they are about to receive what they came for. People slowly edge closer to the set as Sheldon prepares for his next line. Sweat is clearly visible on his brow and his mouth is quivering in anticipation as he readies himself for what is about to happen.  ""I just prefer Firefox because, like the fox, I am cunning and nimble.""  The crowd suddenly surges forward as the words escape Sheldon's mouth. They are so powerful, they almost shake the very foundations of the CBS studios. He watches as, in what he perceives as slow motion, the crowd moves toward his fragile body. He has been preparing for this moment his whole life. This is his moment. This is his Emmy. This is his Golden Globe. This is even his Oscar. The crowd converges around him so quickly they ignore the trampled cries of Leonard and Penny, who now lie shaking on the floor, their bones crushed by the sheer mass of the crowd. Sheldon stares back at the eyes around him. What he sees are no longer people. What he sees is the human psyche stripped down to its core. Their lives, what they were before this moment has been forgotten. Ravenous. Hungry. They want one thing from him. Sheldon closes his eyes, clears his mind and relaxes his body. What happens next depends completely on the next few seconds. The time between this and what he mutters next feels like an eternity. Slowly, he opens his eyes. He looks at Leonard, then at Penny, both lying lifeless on the floor. Without a second thought, he says with resounding conviction...  ""BAZINGA""  In a split second, the crowd pounces on his ready and waiting body. Man, woman, child all at once. Sheldon cries out in complete ecstasy as they consume his flesh. He stops suddenly, as he drifts into eternal slumber. Peace at last.

","1. Of course the ""outrage"" is from prosecutors and journalists: people who likely know nothing about video games, and do not recognize their value as a medium of entertainment and art. Lol, I guessed IPN (the Institue of National Remembrance) was going to be mentioned, because it's just the kind of thing they'd take umbrage over.   I'm Polish and I don't feel insulted. Now, the phrase ""Polish death camps"" does tick me off, but almost no one who says it means it in the way that they were Polish-run, and if they do, they're usually just misinformed.   However, what would really piss me off is if the game is banned or in any way censored. We don't lynch Hollywood actors for portraying Nazis, but pixels representing fictional Nazis are too much? I heard no outrage about Wolfenstein 2014, WHICH FEATURED A WHOLE GAMEPLAY SECTION IN A NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP.   This is dumb and embarrassing for people who are trying to make this a thing, and for Poland as a whole by proxy. Every fucking time this comes up some cunt runs to file a complaint with the prosecution and another cunt in the govt demands an apology from Germany, when *Germans are the last people who would make that mistake with the phrasing*. The subject is not taboo just because sometimes people don't already know the history and need to be corrected.  It's just exhausting.
2. 	> Lol, I guessed IPN (the Institue of National Remembrance) was going to be mentioned  From what I understood from their message on IPN's page, they actually went after that cunt that modified the trailer (and has two more cunty videos on his channel), not after the actual game itself.  The journalists however - especially the rightwing ones - seen IPN's message and went after everything. No surprise there, lol.  >  Germans are the last people who would make that mistake with the phrasing.  You would think so. Sadly, you would be wrong.  - http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,6928930,_Polish_Camps__in_Polish_Court.html - https://fakty.interia.pl/news-byly-wiezien-auschwitz-skarzy-zdf-za-polskie-obozy,nId,999725

","1. The rule of the thumb is, if you want to find something out, ignore the journo, and read the survey. People not liking ""political correctness"", doesn't mean their views are otherwise encouraging, and while they dislike it in similar proportions, it's far from clear that what they mean by this term is at all similar.
2. 	My rule of thumb is, if the alt-left hates it, I’m gonna love it and I buy that thing. 9/10 I do enjoy it and doing it out of spite of them makes it 11/10, would bang again for me
3. 		So you buy things out of spite and hate? I mean no offense but this seems like pretty extremist behavior. ""What, these people hate the Klu Klux Klan merch that they're selling for fundraising a racist organisation? ILL JUST BUY SOME TO OWN THE LIBTARDS LE EPIC STYLE""
4. 			I think his point was that if the usual suspects are clutching their pearls and calling something problematic, there's a decent chance it's worth looking into.     For instance, when the whole comicsgate thing kicked off and our boi Zach kickstarted his book, I ordered a copy. I've never been particularly into comics, but I like the goofy motherfucker and I had the cash laying around so why not?     If a creator has the balls to stand up for their vision and tell all of the current-year moral inquisitors to get fucked, there's a pretty decent chance I'll be willing to fork over some cash and support their product. 
5. 				Now we have to worry that IndieGoGo will arbitrarily decide they don't like him and cancel the campaign right before completion like they did with Chuck Dixon.
6. 					I'm getting sick and fucking tired of middleman faggots dictating what I can and can't buy, what media I can consume, what opinions I can express, and every other fucking facet of my internet life. They're like a more-insufferable version of those Amazonian dick minnows that swim up your peckerhole and shoot barbs into your urethra. And as if that weren't bad enough the parasitic little cock-burrowers have the audacity to demand that they be able to peruse a menu and pick which dickhole they prefer to infest.    It's fucking ridiculous. I pay money to a content creator to fund his work, and the site leeches their cut off the top. That's how the game works, and I'm cool with that. Gotta pay if you want to play. But something's clearly and inherently broken when these modern day pharisees cut into their own profits to prevent a perfectly legal transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller.       These are the types of things that drive men to take drastic measures. There's a miasmatic aura of frustration and anger lurking just below the surface of polite day-to-day discourse in this country. (U.S. I won't speak for the rest of the west, though I suspect this is true elsewhere) The fact that the myriad bad actors on the left seem dead set on hacking through the last handful of threads holding our collective decency together is honestly highly concerning to me. I feel like we're a handful of bad actions away from crossing the line onto a one way street not one of us is going to enjoy very much.    Sorry about the wall of text. Sometimes I get on a roll and lose sense of when to shut the fuck up.

9. 								By that line of reasoning the wife agreed to giving a lifetime of blowjobs, yes?  Of course she doesn't owe him blowjobs. The very idea is absurd.   And, by the same token, he doesn't owe her a single fucking dime of his money.  > be a man and follow through with your vows  One of those vows is ""for richer and for poorer""  A ""Strong Independent Womyn"" can pay her own goddamned bills.
10. 									A lot of this thread seems to be outright woman hating.  The point of the argument is that he should not cheat because he made a vow and she is crazy for trying to steal all his money.  Both are in the wrong
11. 										I find it somewhat amusing that asking women to to pay their own way is seen by you as ""outright woman hating"".  Cheating is a despicable thing to do, I agree with you on that.   But a woman who cheats on a man doesn't owe him money. Can we at least agree on that?
12. 											Of course we agree on that.  Of course! But where did we get that she cheated.  We know for a fact he cheated.  That’s all I’m saying.   I think we are both saying the same thing

","1. People whine this sub doesnt support liberals or hates them. This isn't true.   Here's the thing. And reminder, jokes require truth as an element to be funny.  The left can't meme. Why would shitty memes get up voted in general? They don't. They left can't meme. One in five hundred sure. So left wing memes don't go anywhere because they suck.  The left can't argue anything past surface level bs. Many of them have the depth of a puddle, mentally, and can argue one position. The one you read everywhere. The one jerked off in every leftist subreddit. It's never taken beyond that. Ever. It's just jerked off.   People whine fox news is bias. Fox news started as a Christian conservative network to combat leftist perceived slant, so, suggesting they are bias when they literally started to combat liberal news is beyond retarded. It's tiring listening to leftist media whine about trump all day and not report actual news while saying they are neutral and its frustrating talking to people who can't see the difference. It's boring talking to people that do the same. You don't learn anything you just keeping staring at the same wall, never walking through any doors. Talking to a leftist is watching paint dry.   Everything's a cheer leading slogan. Their views fit into the character limit of a twitter comment. What they promote and what they do are 100% the opposite. The left act like women. It's tough being around a guy who acts like a woman. It's tough talking to loony leftist women.  Its not that the left isn't tolerated here, it's that they are often horrible stereotypes with nothing interesting to say that offers critical thought, funny thought, etc. Nothing that's worth up voting, nothing that orzbluefog thinks is amazing.   A leftist laying out a step by step plan of how anything they offer actually works, that would be a good thing to add. Yet, nothing. Go look at a libertarian party and you'll see a real breakdown of how something needs to be done. Look at leftist, it's just ""get government to do it"" or ""raise taxes, create a tax.""  So firstly why did you read this (I'm killing time in a hotel) and secondly I want to hear a leftist actually lay out a plan and be the first leftist to actually do it.  ****Tldr**** fuck all anything worth reading.

I could replace you with anyone else from the ideological left and we'd have the same conversation"". Something like that. So many people can't give a real 'why' as to their beliefs. I totally agree with you because I see so many following and don't think about the consequences.

This sub is a hospice for men where men can break free from societal propaganda and brainwashing.  Of course people who learn they have been lied to their entire life are going to be angry.  The red pill rage is a normal step of the process and most men here do get past it and move towards indifference to women.  Don't attempt to tone-police since this sub serves the valuable role of being a place to vent for men. What will men vent about? Their problems in life. What is the main cause of problems for men? Women and the society that enables their cancerous behavior.

7. 						Here's one.   Allow you to tell you the story of my favorite character of all time. A neutral evil Human Sorcerer who had max ranks in Profession (Lawyer) since game one.  He was a scrawny man, tall and lanky. Fine black hair and the like, and the traditional evil goatee, And yes, he did stroke it occasionally.  Well, It all started when the party went to a little farming village who's average IQ was likely on par with a jar of mayo... On the way out, my Lawyer had a brilliant idea to get some money... The only shop in town is essentially a pawn shop, so I go out to the fields and pick up a few rocks... I cast Light on them... And bring them back to the shop as ""Health Stones, As long as you carry one, you'll never grow ill! Look at how they glow!"" The moron gobbled it up because the town didn't know I was a spell-caster of any acclaim.  That was the start of it..  Second major evil act of mine was using my characters extensive expertise in the law to force a Ma & Pa style Inn to sell to him otherwise he was going to have the place seized for owed taxes... He then turned it into a whore-house... And then burned it down for the insurance money.  After that the party Paladin got fed up with my way and challenged me to a duel of blades, I accepted and surrendered quickly.. And then using my insanely high charisma I convince the Paladin that I've changed my evil ways, that I'll give it all up... So, he allows me to buy him a drink... Next thing he knows, he wakes up in a motel room with a dead hooker on the floor, and outlawed narcotics on the nightstand.  I retired the character shortly thereafter, going off the RP reason that he went into hiding to avoid retribution from the Paladin's Order.  Good times..

","1. To be honest, they wouldn't be doing this if there weren't so many unbelievably thirsty guys who keep giving them money because ""boobs"".  As I've often stated on reddit, there is no community more thirsty on average than gamers.  They also tend to have extremely limited experience with women in general, let alone the good looking ones.....so they take that inexperience and their default ""white knight"" thinking and go full retard with it to the absolute delight of women.   Anyone who has played an MMO has seen just how incredibly far the rules bend when the player has a vagina versus anyone who doesn't. I don't play a lot of online games anymore but I imagine in general, it still holds true that girls don't have to play by the same rules men do.  Ah well, nothing you can do about it...you can't force a horse to drink water any more than you can force a man to confront the fact he doesn't know shit about women at all.....they have to get their on their own before they can start making progress.

3. 		I rolled a female DH last expac, got m'lady'd within 10 minuets and rerolled a male. 
4. 	the weird thing is you think this only applies to gamers. the average man isn't great with attractive women, period. a handful of the most confident and/or ripped dudes, are the only ones who get enough attractive ass, that they can afford to not give a fuck about obsessing over and sucking up to hot women.
5. 		> the weird thing is you think this only applies to gamers  Show me what I wrote that demonstrates I believe it applies *only* to gamers.  I know what I wrote and I certainly know what I think.....what I don't know is how you came to that conclusion.  I only mentioned the gamer aspect because it was relevant to the topic, not because that was the only area I'm familiar with.
6. 			well you singled out gamers and claimed they are *especially* thirsty compared to the basic male population. really it's just men, men are pathetically thirsty. that's why the concept of pussy passes exist in general society at large, because all men are slaves to the pussy.  also it just plays into the ""gamer nerd"" stereotype which is pretty much from the 80s and early 90s. gaming is so common now, that the ripped as fuck dudebro at your college who smashes the kind of girls you can only jerk off to, probably plays battlefield and COD in his spare time. in fact i know several guys like that. gaming is no longer a niche hobby secluded to neckbeards and awkward virgins, it's mainstream, my man. then again, it depends on the game i guess. guys that play WoW and similar games fit the stereotype in your head, guys that play mainstream AAA games and popular online shooters are just regular ass people now.

","1. Intentions aside, it's just retarded to have something like that in a game. Unless it's literally filled to the brim with comedy and is parodying tons of things, like Saints Row or something.
2. 	Yeah, I could definitely see a Saints Row like game taking the piss out of Incels and Nice Guys.
3. 	It would have been written by a character called Shaun, an Assassin who writes the codex entries with snarky comments and has been doing so since Assassin's Creed 2.  Something like this is in character for him.
4. 		Fair enough. That's actually something I can hang my hat on. 
5. 		Since it seems like you may have an idea, I have a question for ya. Since Desmond dies in 3 (he *does* die in 3, right?) who do they use as the modern-day player character? I'd always wondered about that since I haven't played past Brotherhood. 
6. 			Idk about Odyssey, but Origins had you play a woman unrelated to Bayek (the main protag) that worked for Abstergo (but wasn't on the actual Animus project).  For 3, 4, Unity, Syndicate, and Rogue you basically are a first person floating head in a mock version of actual Ubisoft owned by Abstergo. 
7. 			Shaun is an NPC you meet, see and speak too in 2, Brotherhood (assuming he's also in revelations, haven't played it yet, same as 3), Black Flag (undercover and isn't writing the codex entries in 4 and Rouge, and i'm going asssume he's writing them in Unit,Syndicate and Origins)  As for modern day player characters. to show that the Modern day fight against the templars isn't over and to build up things (The modern-day character in black flag joins the Assassins and the Rough modern day character is forced a gun point to join the Templars)  And yes. Desmond does die in 3, your memeory isn't failing.
8. 	don't become like them: a humorless cunt, laugh it off
9. 		If it was fitting, I would laugh at it. There's a time and place for everything. Make it a joke that fits and fine. What's this have to do with the game? How does it fit the tone of the game itself?   If it were a fart joke it'd be just as retarded to me in this game.   edit; Don't be like them and tell people what they can and can't do and feel. If you want to think it's fine, go for it. Doesn't mean I have to agree with that. I don't think it's fitting. If you think it's fine, great. The world moves on. 
10. 	Lol what? It's a hidden little joke not a main story quest.
11. 		lol what? It's still in the game.   A game that I assume is trying to be somewhat serious in tone. Thus it doesn't fit that kind of game. Whereas such things do fit something that's taking the piss more than not, like my example of Saints Row.   You're probably one of the people that liked the ""what are those"" meme in Black Panther. ""It's just a little joke!"" A bad one. 
12. 			A game can be serious and have jokes. Witcher is incredibly serious yet has some hilarious moments. Comedy and drama are not mutually exclusive. Comedic relief is one of the most important features of serious stories.  No that joke was physically painful.   Also, don't go ""you're (probably) one of those"" in any kind of debate btw, makes you look desperate to label someone which is a sign of failings on the labelers side.
13. 				Comedy still has to fit the tone.
14. 					It's fluff text. If this were a joke in a serious conversation I'd agree with you, but this is a disconnected little joke to give the curious player a little giggle while they're reading through these things. The idea of some overly desperate dude isn't new or crazy either. This is a pretty tame joke that could fit into most any game regardless of the nice guy meme.
15. 						Can't be that desperate if he intends to kill all the competition. With a stick.  I never liked disconnected bad jokes in serious works. Imagine if Geralt went on a non-canon time travel romp on the Delorean. The damage would still be done even if it doesn't ""count"".
16. 							Lol  Right that'd be crazy, but this isn't our PC, it's just some rando who means nothing. Its just goofy for when you're playing the game past its core story. Every RPG I've ever played has had something like this and they're always fun little additions imo. We're using Witcher so I might as well continue to. Remember the time when you had to find that womans pan and how silly the mission was. I feel like that kind of stuff can really breath life into long serious tales. It's the reason the stuff is in pretty much everything of a similar nature. GoT has gotten a bit over the top with it lately, but early seasons featured a great example of how to intersperse comedy throughout a serious drama to keep it from feeling too intense. Not saying AC is up to either of those examples' caliber, but it's the same concept.
17. 				This isn't an off handed joke, it's a very pointed one about something very specific that has zero to do with the game or the tone it's going for.   Also, don't tell people what to do. 
18. 					I mean the fact its hidden in random npc backstory seems pretty off handed to me. Just some goofy text they wrote in. I dont really see who it'd be pointed at aside from a meme anyway. Seems kind of silly to be offended by a joke about a meme in the subtext of a random NPC in a game about a dude who uses DNA to relive his ancestor's life in a fantasy reimagining of Rome... I haven't played the game so I can't exactly say the tone of it, but I wouldn't imagine it's that much different from other Assassins Creeds which always had a level of levity about them, especially lately.  Also, I'll do you one better, don't tell people to not tell people what to do. Bit of an oxymoron.
19. 	I really love this kind of shit in games but they make it read like a twitter post. That bothers me. They can be so much creative with this.

","1. Gaming/Nerd Culture, +2  Plus either Official Socjus or Socjus Attack By Media for the +1  The article literally argues that *Lovecraft contributed nothing to horror besides themes rooted in racism, misogyny and homophobia*. This is going far beyond merely saying he had unsavory opinions. The argument is that *every single Lovecraftian trope is unavoidably tainted and carries within it Lovecraft's own misogyny/homophobia/racism*. Everything good about Lovecraft, the article argues, is evident in the works of previous authors.  The implication is inherently censorious. Not only is Lovecraft to be removed from the canon, but *nothing that feels too Lovecraftian* (in aesthetics or tone) can be permitted.  Not only that, Lovecraft is attacked for ""grossly simplifying"" ""mental illness"" but that just shows absolute stupidity about Lovecraft's depiction. Lovecraft wasn't depicting mental illness or ""actual"" insanity. Legally speaking, insanity is a complete break from reality, but in Lovecraft-land *people in mental asylums are closer to reality than the rest of us*.   This is an atrocious demand. The analogue would be that, because Tolkein had some unsavory opinions that influenced his writing, the entire genre of fantasy must abolish the use of orcs, elves, dwarves, etc.   They're going far beyond merely ""critically discussing"" the work of previous authors. This is a demand for a purge of the canon and even the *destruction of a particular style of writing*. 
2. 	I mean most of Lovecrafts stories are about the dangers of miscegenation and there were others doing cosmic horror almost identical to his without the racist themes before he wrote (William Hope Hodgeson - House on the Borderland 1908) but I don't think any of that qualifies to deny his influence. His stories are the ones that got rooted in our culture. Anyone saying to ignore his contributions or claim they're ""boring"" because he was a racist is lying to themselves.
3. 		No, *a few* of Lovecraft’s stories had the kind of themes that suggest inspiration from his fear of miscegenation. *The Shadow Over Innsmouth*, *Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and his Family*, and if you really reach you can fit *The Dunwich Horror* in there too. You also have some nakedly discriminatory stuff in *The Street* and *The Horror at Red Hook*, which even Lovecraft was like “these are garbage why did I write these”. Outside of that the *most* you can find is the cat’s name in *The Rats in the Walls*, and a few references to “mongrel” folk peppered in other stories or usage of words like “negro” (outside of his rather infamous poem *On the Creation of Niggers*). There’s so much of his work, some of his best even, that has *none* of that stuff, like *At the Mountains of Madness*, *The Colour Out of Space*, *The Outsider*, *The Whisperer in Darkness*, *The Statement of Randolph Carter*, *Dagon*, most of his Dreamlands stuff — the idea that racism was one of the primary driving themes of Lovecraft’s work is a lie being spread by writers who want to brand it politically incorrect so they can discard it unread and force people to read their propagandistic slop.  Lovecraft’s key influences that pervade his work stem from his *nihilism*. That’s the overarching philosophy that infects most of it, not his racial politics which only surface in about 10% of his output.
4. 			The thing is, pretty much everyone back then used the word ""negro"" for black people- pretty much irregardless of race or how racist they were.  Anyway, the primary driving force for his work was probably the nightmares he had as a kid and the fact he was ill a lot if anything.
5. 				Right? Like there was a time when calling someone *black* was insulting, and ""negro"" was the preferred term. So I think it's patently unfair to call that terminology in his work ""racist.""  Likewise, people get so weird about the cat being named ""Nigger Man"" but IDK. It's a little racist but also, 1923 was a really different time, and I didn't really see a lot of *spite* behind the name, just kind of a tongue-and-cheek cat name that reflected the racial attitudes of the era.  Sometimes Lovecraft threw out some racist stuff, but even in most even-minded communities, I think it gets a lot more attention than it deserves.
6. 					Lovecraft wasn't just racist, he was very xenophobic. It wasn't like he was accepting of all people who happened to have pale skin.   But he also had a very isolated upbringing (father died in a sanitarium, mother was overbearing and eventually died in the same sanitarium) and he was plagued by nightmares and sleeping problems throughout his life. I feel bad for him, but he seems like yet another example of troubled minds leading to great works of creativity.  It's a shame he died so young, who knows how much he could have accomplished if he'd lived another 30 years?
7. 						I often argue that Lovecraft's horror works because he had racist views, in this case a strong hierarchy.  It's really logical, you take a position where you see some people as subhumans and therefore your right is to do as please regardless of what they think, like you don't consider the opinion of animals.  Now what happens to you when something new appears and is higher than you in that hierarchy? You expect the same treatment as you have considered to those beneath you. Alien plants dissecting humans and dogs and not showing any signs that they think humans somehow higher beings as the dogs, now that's scary and completely within that world view.
8. 				People know what the latin word for ""black"" is, right?
9. 			Let's be honest, Lovecraft's more racist works haven't endured nearly as much as the ones that display little to no racism. Pick up a Lovecraft anthology today and you'd have a relatively low likelihood of finding *The Street* or *Horror at Red Hook* in there, but you're almost certain to get *Call of Cthulhu* and *Mountains of Madness*.
10. 				I mean it depends on the anthology, because usually if it’s Lovecraft’s own work only then it will be a reprint of one of the Arkham House collections, and those are consistent in their contents (specifically both stories are in *Dagon and Other Macabre Tales*).  But if it’s a mix of Lovecraft and other writers or if the collection’s edited by someone else then yeah, *The Street* is pretty much always passed up, it’s generally agreed to be one of his worst flops. You’ll find it in complete collections and in the appropriate Arkham House volume and nowhere else. *Red Hook* has a lot of problems but it sees a bit more press, as it has a few redeeming aspects (and Alan Moore included an homage to it in *Providence*) but yeah it’s never going to be on anyone’s A-list or B-list.  *The Shadow Over Innsmouth* has the miscegenation angle but also works on a lot of other levels, it’s the kind of story that’s so great it runs well beyond what the author intended. It resonates at a fundamental level, hence its fame.

The US is on a full pushback against mass immigration, meanwhile Sweden still hasn't been able to vote out the social democrats who has turned Sweden into a shithole compared to what it was three decades ago from a security perspective.
12. 				>What country is more cucked the US or Sweden?  Cali vs Sweden is a tight draw between cuckoldry, but allow me to answer your question with another question:  **Who invented and/or popularised all the retardation in the west, from blacked to ""man-something"", to gender studies in the west the last 20 years? Sweden or the US?**  > Being obnoxious and opinionated, no matter how stupid we sound. Which is a major obstacle to any ""keep calm and carry on""  You're right about that.  > Europe always stereotypes and hates us for.  He said after casting Europe into one monolithic block and smearing his brand of pills on one of it's member.  >The US is on a full pushback against mass immigration  Hence why in the 11 of December, dear o' Trump will see if it's k to allow 250 millions more subsaharan people from Africa to unleash their future nuclear engineer education into the west.

He asked a question, and I answered that ""its harder to fullsale something here because everyone is too much of a loud prick to go along with it."" Individualism vs Collectivism is a pretty good scale for why some things are the way they are in America versus many areas of Europe (specifically the Nordic and Eastern parts if you can trust the studies).  ""I didn't expect much, even from a European,"" to not want to push the blame off themselves and act snootily superior. But I guess we both live up to stereotypes of each other.

It's easier and more constructive to say *""fuck off, mutt""* than to engage you guys for the past 8 years, i don't know what happen'd to you guys, but the point is generaly moot and the bant weak i see no reasons to engage anymore, luckily we all still got Australians for the bantz.  > we both live up to stereotypes of each other.

15. 							> He said after pushing the blame off themselves  I didn't push blame on anyone, I simply said a reason why one fell victim to it and one was more resistant.   >  it's always the same incredibly arrogant ""answers"" that come out...  I suppose in some lands ""we are unable to not say our opinion all the time (like right now) because we are assholes"" can be called arrogant.

John Koskinen, the unpunished perpetrator of that scheme (along with his alliterative henchman Lois Lerner), hasn't even been removed from the IRS for a year yet, so I'm not sure which I'd trust least to investigate a real crime: the IRS or the FBI.

6. 					Probably made ole Lincoln wish that he had followed through with his plan to arrest the Chief Justice...if only Trump could get away with half the things that Lincoln did.  Sadly, while Wilson was at the helm when the 16th Amendment went into law (oddly enough, Lincoln was the only POTUS to follow the apparent letter of the law regarding Amendments), his progressive predecessor Taft was also a yuge proponent of income tax too :(  But for Wilson, it always seemed ultra suspicious that he pushed for income tax, won reelection on ""He Kept Us Out of the War"", and then had us embroiled in WW1 less than a year after being sworn back in.     We gave DC a new source of massive funding and DC threw us into the biggest war to-date...

","1. Everyone points to Russia being the danger when it has an economy comparable to South Korea. Everything is directed at Russia when China is the one that is truly meddling with foreign affairs not just in the US and Canada but all over the world.  Russia is a boogeyman that the Left prop up. While I think Russia has problems, if you look into Russian geopolitics and their history it's fairly easy to understand where they're coming from and what their motivations are. For example NATO conducts military exercises in Latvia which is right on Russia's doorstep. The US has put defensive missiles in Romania and as Putin pointed out, 'what's the difference between a defensive missile and an offensive missile? It's just the programming.'  If Russia and the Warsaw pact was still a thing, imagine if they managed to slowly get Central American countries into the Warsaw pact. Then they start conducting military exercises in Mexico. That'd be quite alarming for people living in America and would put them on edge.  The Cold War ended in the early 90's and the USA has acted as if it never went away. Russians are merely trying to preserve their security which includes having buffer states. Russia likes having other countries either neutral or aligned to them between perceived threats.  A lot of people don't understand Russia or Russian history. I feel like if we took more time to learn more about this supposed boogeyman, we'd be closer to easing tensions with them.
2. 	And that's why I'm here, asking the informed conservative shitposters what their thoughts are on the matter. I'm seriously open minded, I *want* to know why they're so bad.  I met a suspicious Russian before (won't go into detail), I just want to understand the motive and whether I should feel threatened about it.
3. 		When the Cold War ended, Russia stopped flying bombers loaded with live nukes. The USA did not. The USA has expanded NATO into former Warsaw Pact nations to the point where NATO exists on Russia's doorstep. US/NATO strategy of containment is still being used where both Russia and China are essentially surrounded by military bases. Like I mentioned, drills are done in Latvia. Defense missiles are placed in Romania.  In the 90's Russia embraced America. They wore blue jeans started listening to our rock and roll. However the Kosovo War happened. Russia didn't use its UN Security Council veto on the grounds that NATO wouldn't use air power to bomb Belgrade. They did. The Russians saw this as a massive betrayal of trust and it's what allowed Putin to rise to power.  Russia was supportive of NATO going into Afghanistan. In fact one of Russia's few military bases is on the other side of the northern Afghan border. The supply lines for our troops there came from Russia, and the Russians used their military presence to prevent the Taliban from running north. However Russia opposed the Iraq Invasion, and used that invasion as an excuse to invade Georgia and Chechnya. ""If the US can do it, so can we."" Was their reasoning.  In the Obama years when the US, France and etc. did their campaign in Libya, Russia was strictly opposed to a no fly zone so medical supplies and such could be aired in. Clinton said there would be no fly zone. Russia didn't veto the intervention in Libya. What happened? Again the USA lied.  Then you have what's going on in Syria. We have had many, many close calls in Syria between the USA and Russia. Dangerously so. You have the perfect conditions for a single fuck up to spiral into WW3. Remember all it took was one guy getting shot to spark WW1. I think the Russians and Americans operating in the area in Syria are likely in communication with each other for this exact reason, so they aren't stepping on each other's toes.  I believe that NATO has been particularly belligerent towards Russia. Russia has absolutely no reason to trust us, and I don't blame them when they take matters in their own hands in matters of their own security.

2. 	Disclaimer: I have never been addicted to opioids and can only relate through people I know who struggled with their addictions.  That said, some years ago I really, really hurt my back. It started on a drive from South Carolina to Indiana (for those not in the U.S. that's a bit longer than the distance from London to Frankfurt, Germany). By the time we got into Indiana, I couldn't walk. Had to ask some stranger at a rest stop to walk me into the bathroom and prop me up while I peed.  My doctor put me on a stack of muscle relaxers and a somewhat-stronger Vicodin derivative. Point is, I understand how you could get addicted to that. The feeling was just so good. If I had any idea how to get that combo illegally I might still be popping them. Fortunately, my doctor cut me off. It's a truly frightening thought. If a measure gets addicts treatment, I'm generally all for it.
3. 		Yeah, a lot of people dont know how insidious and sneaky it is (and I'm glad they don't, because I wouldn't wish addiction upon anyone). I'm not an opioid addict either, but I am an alcoholic and we get put into the same programs as everyone else, and the majority of treatments I've been through have been with people addicted to opioids. We all tick in mostly the same way, just with different substances. Substance addiction doesnt give a fuck about your color, age, sexuality, or economic class; it is very equal-opportunity about fucking you up.

3. 		Thats surprising.. Any sources on this?
4. 			Of course such political labels are treated as subjective.  But stuff like denying freedom of speech, censorship, authoritarian dogma, suspicion of outsiders or dissent, these are traditionally markers for the right wing.  Again feminism is mostly a movement for wealthy or middle class women and its issues such as they are, feature women at the top of the tree like senators, or asking when will we have a female president, not equality at the bottom.  Feminism is funded heavily by imperialist governments whereas genuine left movements and socialism is heavily attacked, often physically attacked with bullets.  Obama was a feminist and he also supported Nazis (the Azov battalion in Ukraine) while undermining socialism throughout Latin America.

","1. MeToo was just the continuation/mainstream version of ListenAndBelieve; so this will fail since people will equate it to #MeToo regardless and the reason why is that during the Kavanaugh protest ListenAndBelieve was also used alongside various MeToo slogans and as a result they end up intermarrying the two.
2. 	Listen and believe never applies when it's a woman that's the perpetrator, even when the victim is a child.  I posted about it yesterday, don't want to link my own post in case that's self promotion. 
3. 		Even when it's conceded, as in the case of Asia Argento, where it's difficult to argue with *photographic evidence*, there's calls to ""be gentle"" - calls that are conspicuously absent for even ambiguous cases involving men.

","1. Can I just say, as someone from Belfast who has been following the case, I don't believe this is an example of PPD. The different stories told during the trial, of which there were many, would suggest that the rugby players don't believe they were raping the girl, but that the girl fully believes she was raped. The sexual acts tread the line of consent and everyone seems to have been very drunk at the time, but I don't really believe this was a case of the girl trying to falsely accuse these men.  It's just a horrible situation for all parties. The girl probably feels like justice hasn't been done, whilst the boys feel they don't deserve any of this nonsense.
2. 	>I don't really believe this was a case of the girl trying to falsely accuse these men.  Yeah this was a case of a girl getting drunk, consenting to sex while intoxicated, then waking up and realizing what she has done, regretted it, and told everyone it was rape, and not only that, took them to fucking court.  I can see a case being made, if a girl is intentionally given drinks or lead to getting drunk, given shots etc to get as drunk as possible, to then have sex with, that could be rape and would stand in a trial.  But getting drunk by yourself, because you want to, and then having sex, and afterwards crying rape, is pure **insanity**.
3. 		> Consenting to sex while intoxicated  I hope after you graduate high school you realize how heinous this sub is.
4. 			If I've learned anything in my time out of educational institutes it is that the vast majority of people are stupid, immature and are happy to blame others without ever being introspective. Women are not expected to become mature in our culture and therefore they are the perpetual victim that is being objectified. But I don't know why I have to explain this obvious shit to an adult. Just be a dike and make another women's life hell and fuck off out of our space instead of venting here about your diminishing social worth.

","1. To the guy who was calling the fans entiled little shits and deleted his comment, here’s my fucking reply to you and anyone else who thinks that way:  Blizzcon’s audience are hardcore fans, and hardcore diablo fans have always been mainly PC Gamers. You can add console gamers too with D3.  If you seriously don’t understand why telling this to your most hardcore fans who have waited over 5 years for any news regarding a Diablo project isn’t retarded then you are. Add to that the fact these guys fucking paid hundreds for a ticket and thousands to travel and stay there only to get a slap on the face. Not to mention the fucking video they released hyping this turd up saying it was a good time to be a diablo fan just to sell more con tickets.  A mobile game is not what any established Diablo fan wants for several reasons. I won’t go into detail because they should be fucking obvious if you used your brain but here’s a small list: predatory monetization and mtx, game limited by hardware capacity of phones, gameplay simplified to work with a touchscreen for a controller, etc. Oh and the fucking company they partnered with that developed the abomination has a horrible history of p2w games.  People aren’t fucking entitled, they’re rightfully pissed at how something they love is being dragged through the mud and how the head of marketing at Blizzard appears to be a dropped on the head as a baby orangutan. So yes, you are totally off the mark regarding your assesment.  And if you even have to ask why the journos that are in bed with developers and get info plus money from them are defending them I doubt you’ve even been here long. They have already demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt they don’t give a shit about their readers and gamers in general.  I’ll be a whiny little bitch according to your opinion any day over letting Blizz spit on my face and ruin a franchise I love without saying anything.
2. 	To be blunt, here's what happened. Blizzard built up hype for a new PC Diablo game so they could transfer the hype over to this mobile thing. This is always a terrible horrible idea. It never works. PR and marketing people need to stop doing this. It just creates a ton of anger, quite frankly, justifiably.   Companies have a role to play in setting proper expectations. When they fuck up these expectations, people get upset. If they don't want people to get upset, then they need to work to maintain proper expectations. 
3. 		hell if blizzard wanted a damn diablo game you could play on smartphones so badly, just port the first game to smartphones, that probably would have gone ALOT more smoothly, you would have gotten at least a mixed reaction...not every gamer, even non diablo fans effectively telling blizzard to get fucked.
4. 	This is the part that people don't focus on enough: the insulting way the news was delivered. The fact that Blizzard is making mobile apps out of their main IP lineup is disappointing and worrying, but ok, it's their products. But they announced before Blizzcon they have exciting Diablo news, gathered people in front of the stream, the more loyal fans bought the digital ticket to be sure not to miss any panel, the most hardcore ones paid for travel and Blizzcon tickets to be there in person... Only then they said ""We have nothing for you. We have a product for a completely different audience and will mock you for being confused/disappointed. Fuck you.""
5. 		I think that is the main thing.  It was downright deceptive of them.  I don't care if they make mobile games out of their franchises.  I will just ignore those and move on with my life... but that they act as if they have a big announcement to a blizzcon style fanbase and then have it be that was just nasty.
6. 		And they waited until it was too late for anyone to back out or have second thoughts to be like ""woah guys, hold your horses, don't get *too* excited (despite how hype we have been)"" to try and have some deniability after.
7. 		It was pretty funny when the developer blamed the backlash on Trump. He ended up deleting the tweet.  https://i.imgur.com/sTYUMy4.jpg
8. 		This is probably the first time they announce a game that isn't theirs in BlizzCon. Blizzard has always had pride for their event and their games (which is why they have so few IP's).  Let that sink in.
9. 	> Blizzcon’s audience are hardcore fans  In the past I would have agreed.  Now it's just a casual/cosplayer party for people that first learned about Blizzard during D3 or one of the WoW xpacs.
10. 		You say that, but would that audience boo them when they said the game wouldn't come out on PC?
11. 			Of course the casual Twitch streamer D3 players are going to be upset about it.  Blizzcon is as hardcore-centric as E3 is.
12. 				There's a rule against being a dickwolf right? I mean, you're pretty much trolling at this point.
13. 		You gotta be pretty devoted if you're paying that much cash to get in there though.
14. 		Me and my bros used it as a giant ""pick up nerdy chicks"" weekend, with some swag along the way.   But yeah, the parties are what it is much more known for in the last few years now that other companies are attached to it (Intel and Wowhead threw some cool ones).
15. 	You would think that dumping all that money into PR and advertising would put the onos of good communication on BLIZZARD.

","1. Not rape. Sexual assault. There is potentially a rather large difference. Might wanna have a look at fixing that thread title.
2. 	So that makes it better, huh?
3. 		No, but it means the title is a lie. Could have said ""murder"" as well, and that wouldn't be true either.  Raping is a somewhat higher degree of accusation than groping is, do you agree?
4. 			“Sexual assault” and “rape” will do the *exact* same thing to a man’s reputation.
5. 				And so will ""necrophilia"" but it's still factually incorrect. Why wasn't that the title?  Jesus, this subreddit is fucking retarded sometimes.
6. 					No, it wouldn’t have the same effect. “Sexual assault” will get you called a rapist all the same, “necrophilia” will not. Stop starting shit for no reason.
7. 						how the fuck is that relevant? I wasn't starting shit. I was saying the title is misleading. And it is. Because she never accused him of rape, which would have been fucking silly for her to accuse him of having done in the middle of an arrest, you daft cunt.'  I understand that you only give a shit about your incel reasoning of ""IT'S AFFECTING THE SAME!"" but it's misleading in reading the god damn article as you have to get through it and go ""ah, right. Sexual assault. That makes a whole fucking load more sense.""
8. 							When someone sees “sexual assault” on a headline, they are not thinking about fucking groping, you idiot. People automatically go to rape, when it’s a dude especially. And yes, you are starting shit, because whether she said rape or sexual assault it doesn’t matter; she’s a piece of shit excuse for a human being and he had his life at stake. And both claims would inspire identical reactions from people around him.
9. 								> When someone sees “sexual assault” on a headline, they are not thinking about fucking groping, you idiot. People automatically go to rape  Only if they're fucking idiots. Whenever it's rape, the papers fucking say rape, because it's an impactful word that sells. So my point is OP is a fucking idiot, and you are too.  And however much your statement is true, that doesn't excuse lying for a better title. Or better yet, sharing the article without even bothering to read a fraction of it.  Calling it accusations of rape when it wasn't is as bad as the people that you're talking about that react the same to accusations of diddling and accusations of rape. So congrats, you're as fucking retarded as a feminist. 
10. 									Whenever it's rape, it says rape? Funny how often I see ""sexual relations"" and ""sexual assault"" whenever it's a woman, then.  My point is, there is legitimately no difference in what people would think of this man whether she cried rape or sexual assault. When people see ""sexual assault"", they get pissed. And if you disagree and think that they'd get different reactions in general, then that's fine. But fuck off. Because at this point neither of us is convincing the other of anything.
11. 										You are having an entirely irrelevant discussion with yourself. I have over and over again said that how people see it is absolutely fuck all to do with this. IT'S FACTUALLY WRONG TO SAY SHE ACCUSED HIM OF RAPE. If you disagree with that, you're as dumb as a flat earther. It's not up for discussion, it's just facts.
12. 											It has EVERYTHING to do with this. I could not give a single shit with what specific charge she tried to ruin someone’s life with when it would effect the situation **the same fucking way**. If you would apply an ounce of logic to your thought process you would understand how irrelevant your “um ACKSHUALLY” crap is, we’re not comparing stealing a Twinkie and boiling the Pope alive. The long-term effects of both sexual assault charges and rape charges would each be the same, and if you don’t think that matters then we just disagree on a fundamental level.
13. 												Alright, then it could have said necrophiliac as well. It would also have resulted in a shunned person, getting no jobs and seeing only disgust. SO I GUESS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FINE TITLE AND NOT MISLEADING AT ALL. Idiot.
14. 													Christ, you’re a fucking wall.
15. 														No, it's just that your argument where ""it's like the same thing"" is so easy to disprove, but you just pretend like it isn't. You have to pick one. Either you mean what you say when you say ""it's the same end result"" and then it could have fucking said anything, or you mean what you say when necrophilia isn't ok, and then calling it rape isn't either. It's factually wrong. There is no opinion to be had here. Did she say rape? Nope. Then saying ""she said rape"" is false. Can you argue against that simply saying she said something that she didn't is false? No. Becuase it's not a matter of opinion. Your arguments are weaker than a flat earther's.  Easy question since a lot of text seems to confuse you: Did she or did she not accuse him of rape? Yes or no.
16. 															No, she did not accuse him of rape; does that make you happy? I don’t know why you’re so passionate about the title being slightly wrong. That’s like calling someone out for saying someone was killed with a shovel when it was really a baseball bat.
17. 																No, it's like calling out someone was killed with a shovel when it was really beaten but not killed by a baseball bat. They're wildly different levels of accusation.  Am I happy? Well, in my very first post, all I said was that the title was factually incorrect (which you have finally admitted that it actually is) and I got you and your gang of noodle heads attacking me like I had said all men should be castrated. So am I happy? Not really, but if you now go and read my first comment, knowing what you know after having admitted that the title was wrong, ask yourself ""why did I feel attacked by this comment.""
18. 																	Did I feel attacked? No. Did I feel that your comment was pretty pointless? Better.   And I didn’t “admit” anything, my entire argument is that the inaccuracy of some reddit thread title should have absolutely zero effect on how someone looks at this situation. And that in the *real* world, most people wouldn’t care to make the distinction for this man when they saw his name. Whether you believe it or not, that is what matters in this case. The public eye. And by the way, my shovel analogy accounts for public reaction, which again, is what matters here. People give a shit about the difference between life and death, contrasting to the grouping of all sexual offenses as one prime offense against women or whatever. You may be smart enough to make the distinction, but don’t have faith in everybody else to follow suit.

","1. It's best to not even get into an argument with them. You'll never change their minds and you won't change their behavior. They genuinely think there's nothing wrong with the fact they've fucked 100 other men in their 20's (as long as nobody finds out.) If you attempt to call them out on any of their behavior, they're just going to throw out the predictable insults about being a ""beta"" ""loser"" or whatever.  They take no responsibility for their actions and life choices in many cases, and can't stand not winning an argument and made out to look like a slut, even when they are obviously sluts.   Still, I enjoyed reading your back and forth so props!  Also it's ironic she calls mgtows ""children"" when from my experience it's most women who have the maturity level of a child, or perhaps a high school student.   The fact she would even post some of the insults she did proves to me she'd never make a good wife.. women are supposed to be the compassionate/understanding sex, but my interactions in real life tend to reinforce they tend to act more like this particular specimen you stumbled across. 
2. 	I know that, you are right of course. It is a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine to debate idiots. Never intended to make her reconsider, instead I wanted to see if she tilts. Had great fun doing this ;) She ended up blocking me, I call that a victory!

","1. They're in the second stages of population growth wherein they have access and knowledge of basic medical care that greatly increases the life expectancy and lowers infant mortality but also have the child bearing habits of a generation that did not have these things. Why did people in the old days have 12 kids? Because most of them died. Why did was your grandmother one of 10? Because she was part of the western worlds shift through that stage of population growth.   This has happened in every first world country, they're just a little behind. Over time, as education increases the birthrate will stabilize.
2. 	Which will also prevent the myth of ""over Population"".  We Need to help develop all countries so the birth rate stabilizes. This Happened to more than 90% of All countries on earth already so overpopulation just wont Happen 
3. 		We have the technology now to run tightly targeted programs of extermination in poor countries, particularly the ones that have cool wildlife and scenery that's ruined when poor people chop down rain forest and kill elephants and stuff.    &#x200B;  &#x200B;
4. 			I hope you're joking/trolling cuz you need help if you think it's okay to ""exterminate"" people in poor countries. They're people, not bugs. 
5. 				You only care about people because you're people too. Like you said, if they're bugs then fuck em kill em all no one cares, because you're not a bug. If chickens could talk we'd have chicken rights on the constitution and colonel sanders would be the new hitler. Killing people is just killing people, hell we kill babies on the womb and sentence criminals to get murdered, if it's right or wrong depends on your perspective.
6. 					>if it's right or wrong depends on your perspective.  And the perspective of society. there are things that are and aren't socially acceptable. Genocide just because you're living in a 3rd world country isn't right, at least in the society I live in. Exterminating bugs is right UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES such as infestations or invasive species in or around your home/investments.  It's not just MY perspective, but the perspective of the social majority which is what leads humanity.  But sure, continue to compare a human life to that of a bug or a chicken, they're totally on equal footing. 
7. 						What does it matter what the social majority thinks? Humans are just a slightly less retarded version of monkeys. The opinion or desires of a collection of them doesn't define what is right or wrong. We agree on not commiting genocide because it's convenient to not get murdered and go at war, but it doesn't imply that an individuals life has any value. That's why I don't find it hard to equate humanity to chickens and bugs, it's all just bags of meat. Yeah we have oposable thumbs and lawyers, still bags of meat tho.
8. 	That's not quite it, but the retards of this sub will upvote you, because what you wrote seems sensible at first.   What you wrote isn't untrue, but you are wrong to suggest that's all there is to it. People in the 'old days' of the first world had many kids (def not 10-12 as a norm though, more like 5-6) for the same reason people in the 3rd World still need to: one part child mortality, one part life happening (kids moving far away from their family) and most importantly: absence of social services.   When there's no free health care, no pension system to get you through your final 10-25 years of your life, you need some of your kids to stick around to take care of you. 
9. 		You're further proving my point. Their child rearing habits are a result of multiple complex factors that I left out for the sake of simplicity in my original comment.  No need to call people retards.   
10. 			But they are retards.   Both the OP and your comment suggests they are having many kids for shits and giggles without any solid reason. 
11. 				OPs comment implies that.   Mine says it is a result of complex socioeconomic factors and these high birthrates will settle over time as public education catches up with medicine (along with other factors, as you original comment added). I'm literally saying the exact opposite of what OP is.

2. 	There would be actual riots, then probably a bunch of fake accusations just as backlash 
3. 		Same if it was posted in Canada.
4. 			Worse here man.. At least the states have a semblance of political nuance, here you can actually get prosecuted for saying the wrong thing 
5. 				That’s insane. Where are you from?
6. 					Check out Jordan Peterson speak about bill C16 if you're interested on the topic. Can't recommend that guy enough. 
7. 						Except there's literally no jail time in c16. It includes gender identity in the Canadian equivalent of protected classes (like race and sex) for discrimination (Like kicking out someone from your apartment complex for these characteristics). Jordan's opinions on this bill are the same kind of faux outrage this comment chain is telling about. He was ever introduced to a lawyer that would be using the bill in their duties who told him the bill would do nothing of the sort.
8. 							What if he refused to pay the fine? Answer: jail.
9. 								Wrong answer, wage garnishment.  Not to mention this is a silly leap of legal outcomes considering the amount of things that result in a fine: speeding tickets, noise ordnances, etc.)
10. 									If you want to be dumb about it. Seeing as how there's a legal right to the action it isn't stealing or theft.
11. 										It is the taking of another persons rightfully earned income as punitive damage for the crime of speaking ones mind. The only stupid one here is the person trying to color this as a just action by a benevolent state.
12. 											Do you have anything more than a skimming of the Wikipedia or a 100 level legal course worth of knowledge to argue the reason why a legal system has a right to punish I'm all ears.   >Crime of speaking ones mind  If you want to argue the legitimacy of the crime that's perfectly reasonable; since that's how Western legal systems work in general. But don't go saying that the courts don't have a legal right to punish you because you don't agree with the crime because that's dumb.  Fining for harassment is an understandable punishment for harassment by a beneficial state.
13. 												But that’s exactly the point I’m arguing. Whether the punishment was imprisonment or the seizure of property, the outcome of the law is flat-out unjust. Just because there is legal mechanism mandating jail, doesn’t mean it isn’t legal kidnapping. Just because a government body rules your assets to be forfeit, doesn’t mean it’s not government sanctioned theft. Collecting taxes is more akin to seizing rightful payment for services rendered (military, schools, roads), but the seizure of assets as punitive action for a “crime” that does not violate the non-aggression principle, nor violates a previously agreed to exchange of goods and services, cannot be said to be just.
14. 													>But that’s exactly the point I’m arguing.  Then don't go mucking about your argument by calling wage garnishment theft. It's a totally different argument predicated on the legal ability of courts.  >mean it isn’t legal kidnapping.  Considering that kidnapping is defined by it's property of being illegal, that's actually exactly what it means. Otherwise you're just making contradictory phrases. Instead use words that do not rely on just/legal properties like imprisonment or captivity.  >That does not violate the non-aggression principle... Cannot be said to be just.  If the law were based upon adherence to that principle you would be correct. But it's not, so it's just a false presumption. Specifically because you said ""cannot"". Not to mention the inherent subjective behavior of the word just.
15. 														So by your logic, an activist for better policing cannot say that an unarmed black man was murdered because by definition, the state has a monopoly on force? An anti war activist cannot say that civilians were murdered because civilian casualties are not blanket prohibited by the international laws regarding warfare? Can we say OJ Simpson murdered his wife? Or does his acquittal and double jeopardy laws suddenly render his slayings legal?
16. 															>So by your logic...  Actually that's not my logic, but good job for the attempt. My logic is that when a word is defined by it's lawlessness it is inaccurate to use it when the event was lawful. Let's go through your examples:  >unarmed black man was murdered because by definition, the state has a monopoly on force?  Actually, it would be that the killing was unlawful in the first place for whatever reasons that are relevant to this event (e.g. complying with understandable police direction, being a bystander, etc.) If it was a lawful killing then they are wrong.  >An anti war activist cannot say that civilians were murdered because civilian casualties are not blanket prohibited by the international laws regarding warfare?  Considering killing civilians is [protected by international laws regarding warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention) this is a moot point.  >Can we say OJ Simpson murdered his wife  You can considering the reason why legal cases are resolved through the judgement ""Not guilty"" instead of ""innocent"".  >acquittal and double jeopardy laws suddenly render his slayings legal?  No. Primarily because the case could still be tried federally, and thus would not satisfy a logically consistent definition of legal that requires the possibility of an acquittal verdict being the necessary action to render an event legal that was previously illegal for going to trial.  Though ultimately you're wrong because of your inclusion of ""cannot"" without any qualifiers. I never said or suggested anything of the sort. I said you're wrong to use the wrong word and should instead use a different one.  After all, each of these events are indeed killings. So in any event where what was stated is indeed true, they would still be killings despite their inherent legality.
17. 																Yeah your definitely just playing verbal semantics to whitewash reality. I’m just gonna copy paste my response to another, more reasonable responder and stop expending effort on you,  >But that is the entire core of my problem with bill c16. It is allowing the government to use linguistic controls to define reality as they please, and subsequently punishing citizens for daring to express themselves outside the framework laid down by the state. Just because the government says it’s asset forfeiture and not theft doesn’t change the fact that they are seizing rightfully earned private assets without providing goods or services in return. Just because the government says there are 32 genders and counting does not change the fact that human understanding, by and large, categorizes people based on widespread pattern recognition in a binary system.
18. 																	This is just retarded. I'm sorry you can't understand the difference between being accurate and making up your own legality.  >It is allowing the government to use linguistic controls to define reality as they please, and subsequently punishing citizens for daring to express themselves outside the framework laid down by the state.  No, stop being dumb. The bill does nothing that wasn't already covered by harassment, instead it has categorized harassment in specific cases differently. There is no requirement to believe a word view because you can't use it's opposite to harass someone with without being fined.  > Just because the government says there are 32 genders and counting  Can you even source this?  >does not change the fact that human understanding, by and large, categorizes people based on widespread pattern recognition in a binary system.  This is why arguing in Reddit comments is terrible. This isn't what is happening. Consider the case of skin color. There are light and dark skin tones. This does not mean that there are no skin tones between the lightest and darkest, nor that there are different colors apart from tone. Additionally, people of certain tones recognize themselves as not being the correct skin tone and feel uncomfortable about it (e.g. albinism).  This false dichotomy that always pops up is stupid and wrong.

","1. >I'm not keen on mincing words on this one. H.P Lovecraft was a racist  Yes, yes he was.  >and before you go making an argument for separating the art from the artist, let's be clear on another point: so are his stories.  Great job on outing yourself as never having read any of them, other than possibly The Horror at Red Hook.  Lovecraft was racist, that's a given. He was also a brilliant writer, and his lasting influence on horror and pop culture in general is no more than a reflection of that. People will still be reading and enjoying his stuff long after wannabe arbiters of what is and what isn't ""acceptable"" fiction, like your own lovely self, are dead, buried and deservingly forgotten.
2. 	> Yes, yes he was.  No he actually wasn't. He was pathologically xenophobic. Similar, but different. Lovecraft was just as terrified of French people as he was of black people, or Jewish people. His fear wasn't predicated on skin colour, it was predicated on those people being ""The Other"", the thing that is different.
3. 		>On the Creation of Niggers (1912)   >   >   >   >When, long ago, the gods created Earth   >   >In Jove's fair image Man was shaped at birth.   >   >The beasts for lesser parts were next designed;   >   >Yet were they too remote from humankind.   >   >To fill the gap, and join the rest to Man,   >   >Th'Olympian host conceiv'd a clever plan.   >   >A beast they wrought, in semi-human figure,   >   >Filled it with vice, and called the thing a Nigger.  &#x200B;  Yeah, I don't really think so, dude...
4. 			> Yeah, I don't really think so, dude...  Sure, you don't think so, but you are misinformed. See you see that & without context you jump to ""wow this guy is racist."" Sure that would seem self evident without any further information.   But we do have further information, such as the following examples.  >it is not so much that the country is flooded directly with Jewish authors, as that Jewish publishers determine just which of our Aryan writers shall achieve print and position. … Taste is insidiously molded along non-Aryan lines—so that, no matter how good the resulting body of literature may be, it is a special, rootless literature which does not represent us.  [...]  >There is a great and pressing need behind every one of the major planks of Hitlerism—racial-cultural continuity, conservative cultural ideals, & an escape from the absurdities of [the Treaty of] Versailles. The crazy thing is not what Adolf wants, but the way he starts out to get it. I know he’s a clown, but by God, I like the boy!  [...]  The Semitic mind, like the Celtic and Teutonic, seems to possess marked mystical inclinations; and the wealth of underground horror-lore surviving in ghettoes and synagogues must be much more considerable than is generally imagined. … Jewish Folklore has preserved much of the terror and mystery of the past, and when more thoroughly studied is likely to exert considerable influence on weird fiction.  As you can see, the factor wasn't skin colour, it was other-ness, the state of being other, which was the result of his pathological xenophobia. And yes that manifested as believing that blacks, being the most different from Anglo Saxon whites, where in fact inferior, but as any one who has studied the man & his works can see that was the result of his pathological xenophobia.   and it's a good thing he was, if he wasn't we wouldn't have got any of his stand out work, since his work, which is predicated on the fear of the other, simply would not exist without it.   People who just declare that Lovecraft was racist & leave it at that miss the point. His hatred wasn't about skin colour, it was about other-ness, which he described as being inhuman & that's how he describes anyone that wasn't a white anglo saxon of british stock.  At least in theory, since he then went on toe marry a Jewish woman. The mean was a contradiction, an enigma, to simply declare him racist does the topic a disservice.

Despite what many falsely believe, there ARE voices within academia that are open to KIA's mission and we should put literally all our energy into supporting the sane voices in academia.

You keep attacking the **products** of the infection (various trust-fund kids who have taken over creative businesses built by a previous generation, notably in various types of gaming, who've themselves been victims of gender feminist brainwashing.  We'll keep losing and losing until some significant number of us wise the hell up and defeat this invasive plant at the root.

","1. No prison, 45 days in jail, and not signing up for the sex offenders' registry, that's a pussy pass. This is another example of women not being expected to take responsiblity for their actions. 
2. 	I agree that it's not nearly heavy enough, but at least it's a move in a better direction than most precedent.  I think there should be a separate registry for confessed/proven false accusers, one which includes people who commit other major forms of perjury that cause harms to others, because it's fair for them to be marked forever for being willing to abuse power over others and violate others' autonomy and rights. Just like sex offenders.  Edit: I found something interesting, at least there's a website trying to accomplish this same purpose independently. [http://register-her.net/-/mary-t-zolkowski](http://register-her.net/-/mary-t-zolkowski) 
3. 		I still think sex offenders. She should feel shame as she goes door to door and explains to rational full-grown adults that she is not to be trusted to be alone with a man, lest she make up more bullshit. She should have to do this with her employer so the male employees can be sure to never be around her without witnesses to deflect her possible fabrications.
4. 			Then again a few blogs with her info and links to the case would also do the trick.  She definitely deserves the exposure for being such a cunt.
5. 	She may have lied about being raped but if you read the article you'll see that she did not actually name any names or try to put anyone else in jail.   she simply lied that she was raped and got caught in her lie. So while lying about being raped is bad, at least she didnt try to put someone else in jail. 
6. 		Did you even read the article? She accused TWO guys, they were both interrogated.
7. 			No, she didn't. She named one, and that was because police went back and re-questioned her. She also said she didn't want to implicate him.  Look, she's a cunt for sure, but don't change the narrative. She definitely deserves more jail time than 45 days.

Remember how the prior season ended?  _All_ loose ends completely tied up, the sisters with new identities free from suspicion, and ready to start teaching the next generation instead of dying young like their ancestors.  (Plus it would have been a nice little meta thing stopping there, ending the series with magical 7 seasons)
5. 				Yeah, the series was wrapped up perfectly and then they dumped another season on us for no reason which had a worse ending than the previous season. :/ And the entire season was just garbage and added nothing.   I wish I could sacrifice that season and give it to Joan of Arcadia. Which was pretty much going to introduce the devil, or at least a servant of him. Which was dope as shit. But it got cancelled. :'( 
6. 					For me, I'm stuck on a more recent one - _Dark Matter_ had a planned 5 seasons, like _Babylon 5_, but was canceled at the end of the 3rd.  The scale was like, imagine _Babylon 5_ being canceled minutes before everyone arrived at Coriana VI.  Literally minutes.  The final scene of the 3rd season was [](#s ""the arrival of the invasion force of the 'soul squid' aliens from another dimension"").  Edit:  Actually, y'know what?  [You got me curious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_United_States_network_television_schedule), and it turns out there is one from that era I'd absolutely rather have gotten it:  [Threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_(TV_series\)), canceled without even finishing airing the first season.  Invasion by 4th-dimensional aliens.

Also if you don't think that certain country is an ethnostate then you are beyond naive. The formation of that country even blatantly stated it was formed as a homeland for that one group!  You don't see that country taking in any refugees yet their people constantly say that America needs to open its border to refugees.

""The formation of that country"" was not a statement, but the Declaration of Independence stated that people of all races and religions would be treated equally.   Not sure why you have a problem with them.   > You don't see that country taking in any refugees yet their people constantly say that America needs to open its border to refugees.   ""Their people"" do no such thing. Netanyahu is a big supporter of Trump. It's hard-left American and European Jews who say otherwise, and they usually hate Israel as much as anyone.
8. 							You literally are ignoring facts to say it is only white people who are the bulk of people behind sjw shit when in reality they are only one of the two most prominent groups.  Also for the record, who the fuck said that I am white?  &#x200B;  I am Asian. I see some Asian people do sjw shit too if they live in California but they are not part of the two biggest groups who push sjw shit though.  Stop trying to use your strawman of evil juice to discount facts.  &#x200B;  Anyone who cares about human rights has a problem with the cruel treatment of Palestinians by their authoritarian ethnostate neighbors who always can use the anti-semitism card as their golden shield when anyone even calls them out on their hypocrisy or makes a legit criticism.  Many of their expats do advocate for opening borders in western nations yet at the same they fully support denying all refugees in their country.  Also,  American and Europeans Jews aren't a monolith of leftists who all hate Israel and want mass migration everywhere, there are many right leaning expats among their ranks who somehow think it is okay to push open borders for other western countries but not for their own country of Israel.  &#x200B;
9. 								> Also for the record, who the fuck said that I am white?  My bad, I assumed it because the last guy who said these things was a 'pro-white' fellow who wanted to cover up how many white people are SJWs.  > ​Anyone who cares about human rights has a problem with the cruel treatment of Palestinians by their authoritarian ethnostate neighbors   I'm fairly astonished that the humane treatment by Israel is 'cruel' (while blowing up children is apparently fine), and that Israel, a country with a double-digit percentage population of Arabs is an ethnostate, and PA territories with zero Jews are not.   > who always can use the anti-semitism card as their golden shield when anyone even calls them out on their hypocrisy or makes a legit criticism.  Legit criticisms are rare.  > Many of their expats  Jews in the West are not 'expats'. They did not leave Israel.   > Also, American and Europeans Jews aren't a monolith of leftists who all hate Israel and want mass migration everywhere, there are many right leaning expats among their ranks who somehow think it is okay to push open borders for other western countries but not for their own country of Israel.  Yes, but most of the open borders idiots hate Israel as much as any regressive does. So what is your point?
10. 									If you think Israel's world class military brutality is humane, holy shit. No one said Palestine is  innocent either. One can criticize inhumane acts on both sides without picking one.  Legitimate criticisms are rare? Holy fuck we got a member of the defense force here.  There are a lot of problems with that country's policies and the regular Israeli citizens themselves will vocally let you know.  Also there are Israeli expats, you make it seem like there aren't any in the west.  You keep thinking that all open borders people hate Israel, there are many who love Israel but hypocritically want open borders but only in other nations.  You seem to have a extremely biased preferential view towards Israel that is completely blinding you from seeing that they have some real problems as a nation and that some of their expats are huge hypocritical influencers in other nation's politics.
11. 										> If you think Israel's world class military brutality is humane, holy shit.  Very much so. No other country would deal so mildly with a population that harbors and supports vicious terrorists who intentionally slaughter innocents.  > One can criticize inhumane acts on both sides without picking one.  Except that your 'both sides' condemnation of 'Palestine' (which does not exist) was pro forma and only given to justify your attacks on Israel. You are evidently primarily concerned with supposed Israeli brutality.  > Legitimate criticisms are rare?  You have yet to make one.  > There are a lot of problems with that country's policies and the regular Israeli citizens themselves will vocally let you know.  Yes, precisely the same sort of SJW that in the United States calls for open borders. As I told you.  > Also there are Israeli expats, you make it seem like there aren't any in the west.  Your automatic assumption that evil Juice == Israeli expats is incorrect. There are plenty of evil Juice who have nothing whatsoever to do with Israel.  > You keep thinking that all open borders people hate Israel, there are many who love Israel but hypocritically want open borders but only in other nations.  Name a few. I have noticed the opposite correlation. There are very few who want open borders who also strongly support Israel.   > You seem to have a extremely biased preferential view towards Israel  No, factual. It is an outpost of Western civilization that is surrounded by Islamic savagery.
12. 											Keep on making your evil juice strawmans.  You can't seem to understand actual demographics of sjws and will stick in your head in the sand to lie that it is mainly white men and women.   You also obviously seem to think that there are no legitimate criticisms of Israel anywhere so it is a waste to even discuss anything with those who are so Zionist that they are willing to forgo all facts.  Hope their Defense Force is at least paying you for your stalwart defense of their human rights violations and their hypocrisy.
13. 												> Keep on making your evil juice strawmans.  Those are your arguments. Remember that we were not even discussing Israel, but the evil Juice - whom *you* linked to Israel, because... you wrongly thought a significant portion of the evil Juice in the West are Israeli expats. Or at least, you claimed to believe that in order to be able to demonize the evil Juice.  > You can't seem to understand actual demographics of sjws and will stick in your head in the sand to lie that it is mainly white men and women.   What percentage of America/Europe is Jewish?   What percentage is SJW?  Even if every single Jew were a SJW, a ludicrous claim, that would still make most SJWs non-Jewish.  > You also obviously seem to think that there are no legitimate criticisms of Israel anywhere   You'd prove me wrong if you could, but you obviously can't. I have invited you several times now to present your Very Reasonable criticisms of Israel, but you have nothing.  > Hope their Defense Force is at least paying you for your stalwart defense of their human rights violations and their hypocrisy.  You know why critics of Israel are sometimes called anti-Semites? Because there appears to be no reasonable explanation for the amount of hatred that some people have for Israel. I object to assuming that it is because of racism, but I can certainly understand their point of view.
14. 			Misguided? You mean complete idiots. And feminism long ago ceased to be about 'female gain'. With intersectionality, they are advocating for what is bad for women...  
15. 				Intersectionality is just playing people off against each other to rise to the top of the progressive stack. However, when they're in power and all those minority groups want what they're promised, they'll get fuck all. Women have the power now, why would they help their former allies.  Everything they do is about splitting the electorate to funnel voters to feminist controlled mostly leftist parties.
16. 					This stands in stark contrast with the fact that intersectionalists have abandoned any advocacy for women's rights when it conflicts with, say, Islam. It's not about women vs. men. It's sane people vs. crazy people.

","1. I don't mind tattoos on women. I don't have any myself, which often leads to suspicions that I'm an undercover police officer at squat parties and the like. This is reasonable as that group of friends are about 20 years younger than me, I have no tattoos and I don't smoke hash due to my asthma (I must try one of those new fangled vaporizer things..) I have a few piercings though, which helps.  I like celtic and 'modern primitive' or tribal tattoos. I'm not sure they age well though. A friend's girlfriend seems to have a few new 12 by 7 inch tattoos on her arms and thigh. They look great, especially one of an owl, but I do worry that the prettiest girl I've met in years may have just owned herself big time..  I really don't like highly coloured tattoos though, especially around the neck (I'm looking at you, Miss Judas Priest reference catcher..)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Primitives_(book)  
2. 	> I'm an undercover police officer at squat parties and the like  No shit.  People get all these tattoos and stuff to be ""unique"" and cool.  Then they shit on the ""not cool"" people because they dont have any.  Then again I guess it does show my lack of commitment to degeneracy.

It is the very opposite of confidence or assertiveness. It's gotten all out of control.

I teach a 4th year university course in which part of the requirement is a seminar presentation. Students used to stand up and share the results of their research in a way that conveyed their confidence and knowledge. They no longer do. Even if they do feel confident, their culture now mandates that they dial it back and sound like this: My name is Jennifer? My seminar today is on bystander apathy?

She is a drunk mess and we have all been there, she made a nuissance of herself and behaved inappropriately and was escorted out all good and fine.  however now her face and behaviour is shared world wide i think she is paying a higher price than her ""crime""  and if you were honest with yourself im sure youd rather pay a fine or some extreme punishment that your drunken flirting being internationally mocked and shared .  all of us have been a bit of a twat when drunk at somepoint, that doesnt warrant world wide shaming in my opinion
2. 	the world laughs at the video yes but I'd think almost nobody who doesn't know her personally won't remember her name or what she looks like. It's not really a world-wide shaming imo
3. 	I'd hate to be mocked and have some of my advances shared on social media, wait... \#metoo.    
4. 	Yeah I have to agree with this one. When she said ""do you think I'm trying to be an asshole or something"" I felt bad. She was just a mess and trying to catch some dick and the guy was rude from the outset of the video.

I also didn't like the dismissive and self centered way they were speaking about the next (current console generation) going all digital as if people who couldn't afford/don't have access to high speed internet were Luddites holding society back. It was very San Francisco elitist.   When ME3 occurred I was more on the side of journalists. And I even today I still day expecting Bioaware to change the ending is fully on retarded and no chimping out is going to convince me that outrage mobs should force artists to change their production. Get angry and warn others all you want but demanding a change? It happened, get over it and don't buy the next Bioware game.  But out of that incident were reports of people getting on the case of one of the writers and I don't think people should have harassed her but iirc she was sort of flippant and snarky, but all the outlets white knighted cause wamen and that didn't sit well with me.   I wasn't at gamergate ground zero so when I heard of it, I immediately dismissed it as a bunch of spergs crying because some game was in 59 fps instead of 60 fps or other such typical gamer nonsense. However by that time I was tired of gaming press becoming more and more adversarial and making more and more petty, disingenuous complaints so I decided to give GG an earnest look. Additionally I started seeing comic pros act u professional and normie fans were applauding while clutching at their pearls because you could see Ms. Marvel's thighs.  I also didn't like the way I was see more and more judging history based on the oh so enlightened ideals of today.  Some time around this time during a State of the Union President Obama (whom I was a fan of at the time) mentioned the wage gap which didn't sit right. I assumed he wasn't mistaken but I couldn't see how it was legal. And if it's illegal how are these very public companies very publicly getting away with it?   From that I saw some Youtube vids of people I wasn't normally interested in, including  a 2 hour binge of TL;DR on a road trip.  And now I'm a black Alt-right rapist white supremacist puppeteer of world politics.   To PATRIARCHY!!

If someone came at you trying to kill you and you defended yourself, would that make you a fascist for stifling their views that you should be dead?   >100 inbred skinheads  Again, they are considered ""very fine people"" by millions. You're basically insulting Republicans right now.   And so far they have a very high kill count. They have murdered men, women and children. So they're definitely doing something. What's antifa's kill count at? (Hint, reply with ""bike lock!"" to think you made a point.)   The alt-right is out there literally killing people and you think those pushing back are ""shutting down opposing views."" Sorry, but the idea that minorities should be physically removed and killed stops being just an ""opposing view"" after they have shown that they are more than willing to go through with their plans. On several occasions. 
9. 							>A guy carried out a terrorist attack and killed a person. Another screamed ""die n****r!"" before shooting at protestors. Others attacked several people, often with various weapons.  I'm fairly certain that was after the described standoff with antifa and them being prevented from entering the park. Not defending their actions but it wasn't like they were standing up against the violence that hadn't happened yet.  >Like Trump who wants to hit up Bill Gates to shut down parts of the internet?  I can laugh at the retards in antifa and still think Trump is wrong...did you agree with everything Obama did during his tenure?  >Like alt-right leaders such as Richard Spencer that literally, on video, admitted they were against free speech and wouldn't keep it once in power.  Again, you can be on the right, hell even alt right and not agree with Richard Spencer..he's into all that racial shit, honestly not many people give him legitimacy, I bet most of his clicks are people who disagree, like you and me. ""Know thy enemy"" and all that.  >And so far they have a very high kill count. They have murdered men, women and children. So they're definitely doing something.  Uhh, I'm gonna need a source on that.   >What's antifa's kill count at? (Hint, reply with ""bike lock!"" to think you made a point.)  Not just antifa, since they are a bunch of intellectual's children who can't fight unless they attack from the back, like said ""bike lock professor."" We also have BLM on the radical left, screaming ""what do we want dead cops when do we want them? Now"" and we have 5 dead cops in Dallas. Or the Congressional baseball game shooter. There is a very militant group of leftists using violence and pressure to push an agenda.  Just because antifa is full of spineless wimps doesn't mean they aren't cut from the same cloth as those other groups.   >Sorry, but the idea that minorities should be physically removed and killed stops being just an ""opposing view""   Who said that? Lol how would that even work? Buses? Planes? We just round up ""minorities""... Like it's some tiny group? Ok...  
10. 								>Not defending their actions but  But defending their actions. And the neo-Nazis were the ones that started the violence. As several eye witnesses and the courts have found. But hey, keep defending neo-Nazis.   >Uhh, I'm gonna need a source on that.   Seriously? You go out of your way to watch youtube videos of ""antifa"" acting violently, but you aren't aware of basic news? There have been tons of incidents.   Men -   https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/24/killing-of-indian-man-in-kansas-bar-investigated-possible-hate-crime  Women -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville_car_attack  Children -   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneman_Douglas_High_School_shooting  There are other examples if you need more sources.   >they are a bunch of intellectual's children who can't fight unless they attack from the back  Based on your feelings. Based on the factual sources I have provided, fact based reality is different.   >We also have BLM   We were talking about Antifa, though. If you want to bring up everyone on the ""radical left"" then we can bring up everyone on the right and the kill count goes up exponentially. And yes, that includes cop killers like the couple from Bundy Ranch.   The more you want to expand what we're discussing the higher the difference gets. For every incident you can think of, there will be dozens more on the other side. So yeah, ""bike lock"" versus dead men, women and children.   >antifa is full of spineless wimps  Crazy how they're violent ""super soldiers"" while at the same time being wimps. They allegedly beat up the neo-Nazis you defend while at the same time being spineless. The enemy is at the same time inferior while powerful enough to make you cower in fear.   >Who said that?  The people at the rally that The_Donald promoted. The alt-right. Identitarians. Race realists. Identity Evropa. White nationalists. The creators of subs like uncensorednews, cringeanarchy, coontown, etc. And tons of others on the ""radical right"" which are considered ""very fine people"" by the regular right.   >Lol how would that even work?   Exactly. Last time it was tried they mostly used trains, camps and gas chambers on top of regular weapons.   So yeah, when someone starts preaching that nonsense, promoting violence and killing people, it would make sense that others would want to fight back. But I guess fighting back makes someone a ""spineless wimp"" in your eyes.

2. 	> Awful person  Tell me why. This thread is full of praise about the action yet hating the person that did it.
3. 		She wasn't qualified for the position, she supports private and religious schools rather than the public schools she is in charge of, and she is just a cunt in general.
4. 			Vos does not hate public schools.  She does hate the way the teachers' unions have corrupted the system to enrich themselves and indoctrinate the kids with liberal bias, at the expense of really educating them.  She would also return the schools from federal to state or local authority, because schools (outside of DC and the military) are not among Congress's enumerated powers.  (If you believe the ""general welfare"" clause covers schools, Madison, as one of the Constitution's principal authors, addresses that possibility in Federalist \#41.)  I agree 100% with her on both points.
5. 				School should be federal and not state for the simple fact that every child in this country needs the same education so they may all have an equal chance when it comes to applying to colleges. If there is no federal standard, children in some states will no doubt have early advantages over children in others. 
6. 					Colleges in the US have lost pretty much all their usefulness and become communist indoctrination centers, and its because of the very federal intervention which deVos is now undoing.  The same is starting to happen to K-12 schools, and there too it's because of federal intervention but with the NEA in the driver's seat.

I pull weeds by hand, I don't try and eradicate moss and clover, I plant native plants in my gardens. A ton of people do. Shut up about lawns, people, especially if you never make a peep about big agriculture. If my front lawn looks nice, it might just be because I get joy out of gardening and I like to bring some beauty into the world, not because I'm just a shallow white cunt who wants to show off to the neighbors. But no, if you're not wallowing in squalor, you're glorifying wealth. Doesn't even matter to them if you have any wealth or not. Anything nice is immediately bad and displays ""privilege"", even if it's free. (Not saying a yard is free, but what you do with it can be, just like healthy habits and access to information, and so many other things they bitch about..)

2. 	""Bu... But... The game wasn't made in 1899, and should reflect our woke politics!""  Saw that yesterday. Someone was dismissing the historical accuracy of the game.
3. 		“The game has a save mechanic which isn’t found in real life so there’s no excuse for the game not to be woke because they cannot claim it is completely realistic”.  I haven’t seen that argument yet for RDR2 but they did try it with KC:D and BF:V so prepare yourself for that retarded argument as well. 
4. 			It's such a moronic argument. And one based purely in dishonest semantics. Fine, you're right, it's not realistic, it's a fucking video game.  But you know what I like out of my historically based games? Historical authenticity, it doesn't need to perfectly emulate life, but it needs to authentically capture the time period. This can be extended to sequels of pre-established IPs as well... It's one problem with the new Star Wars, and especially the new Star Trek. Yeah, it's not real, but it doesn't feel authentic. Because they've butchered the previously established characters/lore/etc.
5. 			If it had a save mechanic it might be the first Rockstar game worth buying. I dunno what they have in RDR2, but if it's the usual Rockstar bullshit of save before a mission starts and replay 20 times until success I'll give it a pass (when it finally appears on PC 5 years laterzzzzZZ)
6. 				GTA5 had mid-mission checkpoints if you died, I can't imagine they would have gotten rid of that for this game, though anything's possible.
7. 					There are mid mission checkpoints in RDR 2.
8. 				Mid-mission checkpoints have been added to Rockstar games for a few years now. It's really spiked their quality.
9. 			I've seen arguments like that about respawning.
10. 	Yes, and? The reviewer isn't saying that the characters should be woke, they're saying that the game should give more focus to what was bad about that society, explore the subjects. Also to do more with what the reviewer sees as the themes of the game.   Edit: Lol, I got nuked. Why are you booing me, I'm right!
11. 		Yeah i mean, when else i could be reminded about ""what was bad about society back in the days""? It's not the information you could get freely nowadays.

Now i see it, thanks!  >This tribal partisan 'You said something I have an emotional reaction to, you're an enemy and haven't played any games and are probably a communist feminist' sort of response is so dismaying, honestly.

I think you are being slowly converted.  >Don't take it too serious.  So I'll admit that I'm being converted a little bit. Understanding the other side, even if I don't agree with it. I'm starting to follow their internal logic. Mostly I don't agree with their application of power, or the rigidity with which they hold their views and also their partisanship.

13. 				> It's an open world. If you don't want to deal with slavery or whatnot, you wouldn't have to. They could hide this stuff behind gates, sort of a 'Do you really want to delve into this storyline?' choice. The black slave trying not to talk to the PC, which players could either be interested in or uninterested in. And if you can't make a good story from slavery, you're a hack writer.  Well, they are not obliged to make a story about slavery. It is not a valuable nowadays because it is too trivial. It's basically a token plot right now. The peak of art was always about surpricing and shocking(withing the limits of course) people. You could invent something new or just show something familiar in a new unusual manner. Eh, i got a little bit off track here - it's just a game afterall, but anyway. I liked Jango because it was cool as fuck and it was a time where everyone didn't constantly try to shove a portions of wokeness into my face. I myself would like some anti-wokeness in a game - it would make furor and tickle the nerves of people really badly. For example, they could show how people take a pride and come to harmony by fulfilling their respective gender roles in the best possible and selfless way, and how it was important for society at that time, and how everything would fall without this. It's sensitive topics of course. I mean no one, including me, wants to provoke people to hatred and discrimination.  > social/historical immersion  That's not immersion. Having woke storyline in a game about 1899 year is a counter-immersion. That kills immersion. Usually, it wouldn't, but today it would. It's just my personal opinion btw. I pesonally didn't even like the look of main character in last god of war game because he suspiciously reminded me something i see too often nowadays, but lots of non-left people didn't mind it at all. I mean, they could choose the different form of beard, for fuck's sake...  Well, to summ up - they could have a story about slavery if they genueinly WANTED to. Irrelevant game journalist don't have a right to DEMAND this kind of a story from developers. Moreover, the attitude that developers are obliged to make a story about slavery kills the whole point of having it in the game.  > My point was about the accuracy of what this writer was saying  Tbh i didn't even read the article. I just like arguing on reddit and writing accusatory walls of text despite having difficulties with english.  > So I'll admit that I'm being converted a little bit  I could start a conversation about that but i like kia to stay free of politics as much as it is possible. Let's keep clean and healthy at least one place.  > If you don't want to deal with slavery or whatnot, you wouldn't have to.  Yeah, i mean i understand that, but lets not forget the all of this are demanding time.

","1. Has anyone noticed that when something rather unbelievable or ridiculous happens it doesn't matter if it's true the media will just post it up without thinking and it doesn't matter if it all gets proven to be bullshit they will act like they had nothing to do with women like this one getting so famous in the first place?  I'm reminded of the Mars scam which I was deeply suspicious of right from the beginning. They were posting it up left and right and when it was found out that the people behind this were just con artists the media instead of correcting themselves just went silent and pretended it never happened or if they did correct themselves it was just one or two articles and that's it.  This behaviour is constant and they are largely responsible for the state of things in the west today. They do zero fact checking and as long as it will get them clicks they'll post it up especially if it happens to be something like this where they can peddle their worldview and make it out that anybody who is disagreeing with what this woman did is an evil evil misogynist and the patriarchy is real.
2. 	> just post it up without thinking and it doesn't matter if it all gets proven to be bullshit  That's modern digital media in general, topped up by the ""Women are wonderful"" effect. It's all about getting clicks and generating ad revenue through click-bait and absurd stories designed to get readers to look at whatever the link takes them to. So story titles that don't tell you anything and require you to look at the article, even if it's the complete opposite of what the title suggests or flat out false, see [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) for such an example.  Then there are the stories claiming ""firsts"" because of particular sex/genders/races etc when there are numerous examples of the case throughout history, especially in modern media shows.  For recent examples see how the media fell over themselves about how Star Trek: Discovery had the first black or first female captain, ignoring Sisko from DS9 and Janeway from Voyager. The story changed various times because people kept pointing out how such claims were wrong. Firstly Michael wasn't the captain, nor was she the first black protagonist, nor female protagonist. Goal posts kept being moved whenever it was shown how wrong the stories were.  Ironically such claims erase the previous actions of the characters/actors that came before them, but then again instant gratification is a fairly common thing these days where it's all about *now* and the past isn't really worth bothering about, unless someone finds something about it wrong by modern standards and therefore needs to erase it, because erasing history has always been a good idea. Not.

The top post on askreddit atm is from an account that hasn't posted anything else for 16 days and awkwardly uses the word **'immortal'**  It's 'If you were immortal for the next 24 hours, what would you do?' seems a v weird word choice since invulnerable or 'cant die' would much better fit such a short time scale.

Has anyone actually ever been accused or shamed for having their legs too far apart and it being referred directly because of their male gender?  This isn't an issue. It never has been. We have sensitive sexual organs that hang outside our body, between our legs, any rational person with a basic understanding of anatomy either knows this (see:majority of humans), or can be pretty quickly and easily explained.  This is just perpetuating a divide between genders on issues that are irrelevant. I'd rather see a psa educating the very few intellectually retarded feminists, than see a random woman with her bags being used to defend a pretty simple concept. She's not perpetuating any ""manspreading"" myth by doing this, any person regardless of gender can do this.

Asked the woman who had just sat down next to me, who still had plenty of space.  ""Do what?""  ""Manspread like that.  It makes me uncomfortable."" < Verbatim quote.

How do you know what she meant by manspreading? You are the one perpetuating it if you don't address it, and furthermore by bringing it up as a defensive point. It's akin to third wave feminism tactics, which is pathetic.

","1. If you try to file a complaint against an officer, it is legal for them to trick you into signing a notarized sworn statement, instead of a complaint , which is not a notarized sworn statement.   There are hundreds of videos of people auditing police department complaint processes and posting the legal jargon to illustrate the matters.   They try to trick people into legally binding sworn notarized statements.   Here's one channel's adventures. Philip Turner, the victorious winner of the Turner vs Driver case.   https://www.google.com/search?q=complaint+audit+battousai   Edit: cue some complete idiot imagining I am defending the cunt in the post, using their extreme fantasy dreamwork fiction skills based on hallucinations. 
2. 	What is wrong with forcing people to complain through sworn statements? You are basically launching an investigation into that officer, and having it be a sworn statement brings accountability to that action.
3. 		Look up the state laws on requirements to file a complaint, and compare that to the literal hundreds of videos where LEO officials tell outright lies to people inquiring about the process.   A sworn statement can be used as a legal document against you in a court of law, and most likely will. That's why there is a legal standard that elected officials felt the need to legislate regarding the complaint process against LEOs. So the LEOs don't retaliate.   I am still calling the lady in the story a cunt who deserves what she gets, BUT, anyone reading who wants to file a legitimate complaint against an LEO, should NEVER , EVER, NOPETHEFUCKOUTOFTHERE, sign a notarized and sworn document to complain against an LEO. There is no possibility that any half sane lawyer in existence would disagree with me.   The cops purposely trick people into signing legal documents, flouting the law. They literally intimidate people out of ever filing anything, with the easy threats that they can arrange for ten officer witnesses to contradict the complainant's document and use it to prosecute them, and the person leaves the station, and forgets about filing anything again, in their life.   Thus the specific legislations in all the states regarding LEO complaint processes that every state felt the dire need to enact into law to make sure people are not badgered into filing legal documents, or intimidated out of complaining.   Why else would they feel the need to waste all of that time and money constructing such legislation?   Once again, fuck the lady in the story, and yay for good and honest cops who do not try and trick people.   Here's an example. California state law.   ''Providing Personal Information.  You do not have to provide the personal information requested. If you  do not wish to provide personal information, such as your name, home address, or home telephone  number, you may remain anonymous.''   https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/civilrights/citizencomplaintpolicy.pdf   Notarized requirements as stated by most police departments in complain audit videos are illegal, but qualified immunity allows them to openly lie about the process at will with zero repercussions.   Watch your ass folks, and IANAL, so talk to the best one you can find if you ever have to complain about an officer.   Fuck the lady in the OP story.

Some cunt who I apparently wasn't good enough for when we were younger tried to hook up with me. I haven't aged much due to getting rid of stressors and some other techniques. I saw her and in my mind I went ""holy fuck bitch, you're old now wtf, you could have had me when we were young"" and my mouth went like: ""I have to go.""  I don't want you in your old years where I have to check your back for weird growths and you cut your hair shorter than a twink would. I'd have been ok with it if we would have had the younger years but noooOOoOoOoooo, you had to go around fuck all the dudes with long necks and huge Adams apples and who play in a band.  But in all seriousness dudes, hats, stay out of direct sunlight, at least keep your face out of it, sunscreen, clean your face after going out and you'll look 20 until you're 40. Then you'll start to look 30 until you're 60, due to grey hair obviously.  Not sure after that because I haven't aged that far yet. I suggest micellar water to clean your face. First time it will feel like your skin is super soft but after that it just takes off dirt.

","1. **THE ENTIRE IDEA OF ""CULTURAL APPROPRIATION"" NEEDS TO** ----  **FUCK OFF AND DIE IN A FIRE.  FULL STOP.** ----  Every time you encounter a person who claims something is ""cultural appropriation"", laugh savagely at them and tell them they are a fucking retard for thinking such a thing exists.  Make them embarrassed.  Because fuck their insane and destructive ideology.  Time to make such nonsense and gibberish fade into the side of history that is to be avoided unless strictly necessary.
2. 	I still don't understand how using bits you like from other cultures is a bad thing. Appreciation is not bad.
3. 		The whole thing around ""cultural appropriation"" has exactly ZERO NOTHING to do with cultural appropriation.  It is PURELY an excuse for SJW's to get triggered so they can attempt to project their ideological power to control you.  It is a social purity / conformity game, that makes no fucking sense AT ALL with respect to the actual merits of people of different cultures learning and borrowing from each other.  This is why my response to them is not about cultural appropriation, it is about GET FUCKED WITH YOUR BOGUS FABRICATED POWER TRIPPING IDEOLOGICAL INSANITY.  If I was going to even stoop to addressing their nonsensical notion that somehow it's not OK for people to share culturally, then I would begin by telling everyone else on the planet they are no longer allowed to speak or write in English, or to print anything with printing presses.  All the indigenous people of North America can give up all use of metal, leave our grocery stores alone, and go back to eating meat and berries and fish and wearing nothing but leather and woven plant fibers they process by hand.  Because that's how this actually works, if you want to actually add up who could be said to be ""appropriating"" from whom.  The reality is there is no such thing outside the warped power tripping of SJW maniacs.   The sane people in the world call it progress, and celebrate sharing all the good things with our neighbors, because they are good and beautiful, and sharing brings us all closer together.  SJW's are regressive authoritarian idiots.

","1. But the right wing subs are still being shut down. The only difference is there's no longer a hub subbreddit (BanOut) where people actively targeting right wing subs are congregated. At least not publicly. But the ends they seek still remain and are still being carried out. The subs BanOut targeted are still shut down. The accounts still banned. The comments still deleted.  BanOut:2018 is still very much active. Now it's just hidden. Be wary.   Edit: I go into further detail on this and connect some dots further down the thread.
2. 	> But the right wing subs are still being shut down.   You mean racist right
3. 		Are you seriously implying that everything right of center is racist?   And if you seriously were, why would you want them shut down?
4. 			Nope.Not in the slightest. The subs that were shut down were chucker block with racism. They also happened to be Trump themed subs. You can have Trump themed subs without racism you know. You can have have right wing subs without racism.  What fucking part of they were banned for being racist eludes you.
5. 				TIL Chad RP means you're a nazi.
6. 					If you actually have seen some of them, you would realise one of them is literally about jewish conspiracies and filled with racism against them.
7. 						TIL one subreddit being purpotedly racist being banned = a slew of unrelated subreddits being banned.   You people make the most hilarious excuses for a group of people that don't give a shit about you.   I mean wasn't this place fucked by mod fuckery a long time ago?
8. 							Doesn't change the fact that what I say is true.  The only sub that was possibly not part of the racist shebang was a subreddit about making memes from one of them.  How about you provide examples of these ""non racist subs"", archived pages\pics maybe.  Because guess what?  I ain't gonna believe that shit when there is nothing making me think otherwise.
9. 								>Doesn't change the fact that what I say is true.

11. 										Half of these are links to threads filled with shitty opinions, like yours, with no proof backing up their claims, just like you. One link leads to just a blank page with an r/ and that's it. The other is an archive of mdx which only has spicy jokes and shitposts that I could see.  Seems you see racism where others see shitposts. Maybe try and get some thicker skin? Stop drinking soy lattes and prepping the bull to inseminate your wife for you. Maybe get a job and step into the real world instead of stewing in your tribalist bubble full of leftist forever victims claiming to be oppressed while buying $1000 minimum clothes with mommy and daddy's credit cards?
12. 											The shitposts and memes are based off of a subreddit.  In short, the actual source needs to be racist... which it is.    If you actually read the threads you would see the proofs.    A: GreatAwakening was doxxing and publicly harrasing a person. An direct site rule violation.    Why not get it directly from the source? https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%40S8n%20Q  B: MillionDollarExtreme was actually pretty damn racist and BillionDollarExtreme's parodies based off of it were caught in the wake.    It's quite literally in the sidebar for Billion.  >Seems you see racism where others see shitposts. Maybe try and get some thicker skin?

","1. I feel suicidal a lot, too.   Your story sounds a lot like mine, and many others I have heard. Especially the bits about thinking its a good idea to put women on a pedestal. Unfortunately, the 'nice guy' is only a working bit if the girl is 100% mentally sound AND past-wall. And even then, you get coin flip odds that she dips out; maybe financially raping you in the process. Funny how, we provide them stability, love, acceptance. Love that is basically unconditional as it can possibly be: ""Dont be a cheating whore"" and its too fucking much to ask. Modern women are fucked up beyond belief. Facebook / Dating apps / Main Stream Media and just life in general, for whatever reason, ends up producing a lot of disgusting women. Its not even that we should judge them or look down on them for being hypergamous, dating up and across hierarchies. I cant hold something you cant help against you. What I can hold against you is being a cheating whore, like many women are; and are absolutely capable of NOT being. Too many girls choose to have a weak mind. To cop the fuck out of responsibility, and to let things progress in ways they know they shouldnt. I wonder how many of these cheating whores end up blowing it on 1 too many 'good men' before they slam into the wall at 90 MPH, never to see a second glance from a man ever again.   And how fucked up is it that, even though I ""HATE"" my ex and the things that she did to me, and the way she treated me despite my endless kindness and respect; some bit of me still loves her and longs for her. I wish so fucking bad that I had never met this succubus and her constant manipulations and beating phrases into my head still has my brain hooked. It sucks.   And what a crock of shit it is that the 'standard' is for people in relationships to just THROW this word ""love"" around like even 1 single percent of women even have the capacity to love the man they are with without constantly looking for trade-up possibilities and encounters they can cop the fuck out of. How 100% uninvested they can be when they tell you GARBAGE like 'were a good *family*' or 'I love you' or 'I choose you' or '(referring to animals) you make a good dad'. Sooo fucked. Where Im from that word ""Love"" actually meant something. My parents were from that magical time when there was actually incentive and a social standard to find someone loyal and be with them. Not be a cheating whore and dip the fuck out of any responsibility for your actions like many modern women. How fucking sick is it that someone would tell you they care about you using a 100/100 power word, and at the same time be literally ZERO PERCENT invested in your relationship, or even at the very least not emotionally cheating on you or physically cheating on you. TF is the 'right' answer to a woman telling you they love you, if you are average in any way? ""Sureeeeeee you do."" And why would a woman NOT use the strongest, most manipulating words possible; especially when seeing the power they have on men. They see that shit everywhere. Society beats it into their heads like a fucking drum.  Makes me remember those retarded as fuck 'I love you more' battles I would have with my exes. Funny how both girls I used to do that with turned into cheating whores. ""I love you more"" my DICK.  Try to find beauty in different places. Its helped me a lot. Like, the clean air when it rains; a good sunset, cliche things.  And, IMO, if you like gaming at all make sure you have a gaming computer :D. Dont be a console pleb XD  Delete the facebook. Its just dead weight. If people want to get a hold of you they will have your phone number.
2. 	I get you man, also i deleted facebook long time ago, im glad i did, spent so much time on it. Also if you need to talk, might not be able to really help, but im always here, feeling suicidal is a tough pressure. Love you man, and thank you for your words.

Because H.P. was a great example of a man that, even if we were to analyze him on the standards of his own time, took great steps into bettering himself and respecting others, throughout his life. An abused shut-in, that feared everyone and everything outside of his own study, that was able to let go of his prejudices bit by bit, and without ever being an incident (recorded) of him actually denegrating or insulting someone for being of another race. BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!  If these whiny faggots had any marbles left, they'd at least try to co-opt Lovecraft, claim that his work was self-criticism of the man's own biases (which they were), and how people can be reformed if someone reaches out and offers to be a helping hand. But no, fuck that shit! Wrongthinkers, past, present or future, need to be slandered, harassed, tortured physically and psychologically, and led to kill themselves so that the moral busybodies can then morally-grandstand on top of their graves.

5. 		Have you ever run an e-commerce site? Good luck accepting credit card payments from users behind a VPN. You’re going to have a LOT of fraud to deal with.
6. 		It's a fraud prevention issue. Huge numbers of fraudsters will attempt purchases through VPNs, so allowing VPNs to make purchases will vastly increase the fraudulent purchase rate.
7. 		No they are perfectly rational. VPN are useful for 1 purpose only. Hiding your connection and protecting what you do online. Only... it doesnt protect what you do online as they shit stillhas to go through your ISP.   A VPN will tell the endpoint you are in America when really you are a Nigerian prince who just needs assistance getting his money out of escrow.   Not allowing VPNs is perfectly legitimate and not even shady business practice. They are not mentally retarded. They are 100 percent in the right.   Especially when taking payments... 
8. 			> Hiding your connection and protecting what you do online. Only... it doesnt protect what you do online as they shit stillhas to go through your ISP.   e n c r y p t e d data goes through your ISP.  >Not allowing VPNs is perfectly legitimate and not even shady business practice.  I can not agree with it. I do understand that amount of fraud from users that think they are anonymous behind VPN would grow up exponentially, but honestly, I still can no tagree with it.   later edit:  my reason for this is that banning an *algorithm* (or a technology) due to fraudulent use of said technology is retarded. Its same as if they'd ban knives because knives could hurt people in hands of bad people, and having knives enables bad people to use them to hurt people. Adding additional verification steps in case if a user is behind VPN is OK and would be a ""totally legitimate and not shady"" business practice. Violating user's privacy by not allowing VPN is not. 
9. 				So here is how it goes   Your pc > your ISP > Backbone > VPN > VPN's Backbone > Destination.   Reverse is Destination > VPN Backbone > VPN > Backbone > ISP.   Secondly, as someone who works IT for a mortgage company, VPNs are banned for a very specific and very valid reason.   Not every person on a VPN is a scammer, but nearly every scammer is on a VPN.   Simple solution block VPN as legit customers can still do business with a vpn on. Non legit customers will take the chance of doing business unprotected and those from a banned country cant do business.   It is a legitimate tactic and one I personally agree with 100 percent for every single reason. 
10. 					>Your pc > your ISP > Backbone > VPN > VPN's Backbone > Destination.   You do understand ""as someone who works IT for a mortgage company"" that with VPN you encrypt data on your PC and it is decrypted only on VPN provider's hosts?  And that therefore, only parties out of that line that are aware of what you're sending are your pc, VPN and destination?    >Simple solution block VPN as legit customers can still do business with a vpn on  Simple != best.  >It is a legitimate tactic and one I personally agree with 100 percent for every single reason.   Good for you.
11. 						Yes I under stand that... I also understand that for it to provide any kind of speed it must be low level encryption and that your ISP definitely can decrypt it.   Simple solution always equals the best solution when it comes to a corporate decision.   Plus this is the best solution. They already block certain countries, now they just simply block VPNs.   There is no better solution and I dare you to find one. Please... prove me wrong. 
12. 							>I also understand that for it to provide any kind of speed it must be low level encryption and that your ISP definitely can decrypt it.   im really not sure what could you possibly mean by ""low level encryption"" (might be ""short key""? not sure, not sure), but:  -- openvpn supports AES-256   -- openvpn's speed never was an issue for me even with torrents  -- AES-256 is uncrackable as of now unless you allocate a *lot* of resources there.   Even more lengthy keys could be supported for realtime encryption/decryption of data streams with adequate speed.   Speed is only an issue here if you run ancient hardware from mid-90's.   >There is no better solution and I dare you to find one. Please... prove me wrong.   Enforce additional checks to validate payee if he is on vpn instead of playing dumb and saying ""there is no better solutions"". Require OTP. Most banks support OTP.

","1. I kindof liked the catcalling scene.  First, they were going well beyond a simple catcall. They blocked her path, threatened her, and were actively harassing.  And, she pulled a gun on them.   Flipping the tables and even gave a speech, ending with, ""why are you still here?""  It was a correct flipping of intimidation.  ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes""  As far as Im concerned if women responded like that, to getting cornered in the street, there would be less catcalling. They even had the audacity to have a white women, pulling a gun on some POC.   That scene was not exactly as Woke as some of you think.     Turning Bullseye into Dexter was a bit odd, and even calling him Dex..  (poindexter as his last name is canon. lthough also subject to unreliable narrative, Bulleye is a notorious liar and sociopath.)

","1. No thanks. When I want to see furry stuff I can look for it on cringe subs. That said, my stance to this sub has always been no rules other than keeping stuff from straying into illegality or breaching reddit sitewide rules. I will say that if this sub starts getting filled with furry degeneracy I personally would stop lurking so much.  &#x200B;  EDIT: In retrospect, I feel bad for the word ""degeneracy"". It's not my place to judge anyone for their sexual kinks and I should have been more temperate. I won't edit it out because I said it and should own it but I apologize.
2. 	Guy, the Furry community has recently been rocked by a series of sex scandals. If the community isn't in the process of taking a hard look at itself, then it should be.  I won't go into details, but holy shit; I nearly threw up.  I get that not all furries are involved, but a significant fraction of the community is, and many more are making excuses and helping to shelter the worst elements.  We are right to keep our distance from this shit. Don't touch the poo.
3. 		Look, that there's actual degenerates within a Fandom invented around a fetish is no surprise. But I don't see them having to turn into hard policing of their own community because of a handful of horrible people. Id really like to know where you got the fact about a significant part of their community being into that, because I've seen the exact opposite; lots of revulsion and general discontent. But also, being that they're a nerdy Fandom, there was a period of expectation for the burden of proof to show up before people started to light up the torches. That they're furries in this case has about as much to do with their horrible tendencies as gamers have to do with being  alt right nazis.  To clarify, It's basically holding the same expectations over their community as sjws hold over gaming or nerd Fandoms. As a result, the kind of filtering you'd expect to happen to weed out the handful of guys who were into this shit would mean everyone living in the kind of paranoid surveillance paranoia we try to argue against here. As it happens conventions and websites disavowed this guy pretty hard. 
4. 			> Look, that there's actual degenerates within a Fandom invented around a fetish is no surprise. But I don't see them having to turn into hard policing of their own community because of a handful of horrible people  Because that's what you're supposed to do, if you think for a milisecond ""we"" the EDGY BOI GRIMDARK (BLESS THE EMPRAH) allowed retards to do retarded things, you're deadass wrong, **because** you're part of it, **because** you like it you **should** police it, or else what was yours will one day die or changes so much you won't recognize it anymore.  Is it fun saying to a pillar of the old guard to go fuck him or herself? fuck no.  Is it fun being part of a fandom and being known for being the ""rules reactionary"" when you're supposed to be there to have some fun? fuck no.  
5. 				I'd like to think that at the point good people are involved, proper authorities would be notified. It would fall on whoever has actual evidence, circumstancial or otherwise, to do the proper report, and everyone else involved to make sure the situation is known.  What I'm honestly curious is how the policing takes place from here on, in your own words. Because I generally tend to think charitably about people so I don't assume most furries are fucking roadkill and batting dogs in the ass, but that's just dumb old me and my optimistic outlook on humanity. But again I don't go looking and most people I've interacted with from that Fandom never stroke me as the kind, much like this person in the videos never seemed like the type to everyone who apparently knew him.   What I mean by this is that other than reacting with decency and helping deviants face the legal consequence of their actions, applying this veneer of suspicion to an entire massive group of people puts the same sort of unreasonably impossible expectation that sjw types put on us. That impossible self policing where everyone is ever suspect because inevitably someone in there is bound to be bonkers, so might as well be always on a hair trigger. That situation is just as much a fun killer as what you're proposing.  
6. 					> unreasonably impossible expectation  Is not doing actual bestiality ""impossible expectation""? is allowing a well known member of your community being all retarded and shit an ""impossible expectation""?  >impossible expectation that sjw types put on us. That impossible self policing where everyone is ever suspect because inevitably someone in there is bound to be bonkers, so might as well be always on a hair trigger. That situation is just as much a fun killer as what you're proposing.  First, i ain't proposing shit, this isn't a proposition, it's a reminder of what await you if you don't, how many shit did ""we"" lost? from SCP to MTG because ""we"" allowed the cancer that is PC & SJW take roots, i don't know if you did read my post or not so i will quote it again, the answer didn't changed one bit.  > [...] **because** you're part of it, **because** you like it you **should** police it, or else what was yours will one day die or changes so much you won't recognize it anymore.  > Is it fun being part of a fandom and being known for being the ""rules reactionary"" when you're supposed to be there to have some fun? fuck no.  Againt, it ain't fun but it's neccesary, wait to lose 3-4 more shit because it got invaded and corrupted by rabid SJW and you'll fuel your engine on hatred alone. 
7. 						You know, my dude, I see where you're coming from. And that's allright. I don't think we'd see eye to eye on this, because I'm not one to do the whole hatred stuff, but that's just me, and if that works for you, best of luck with that.   I've been dealing with that community a lot for a long time, and I only ever found out about that person due to this whole drama popping up. I know that's very circumstantial of my own experience, but it does come to show that ""well known"" in this case is pretty fucking relative. Which, by the way, makes me glad to know that even when the dude in question was this middling sort of low tier eceleb, he got taken down from everywhere rather quick once everything came to light.   And, to reiterate, you're saying if we don't self police we become the cancer, I'm saying what you're calling policing IS THE CANCER. Because it takes us to be collectivists, just in case someone who might or might not become relevant has dirty laundry. You're advocating for the disease thinking it's the cure, all the while arguing for being fueled by hatred or some shit. That's self evidently not the way. That's how we become them.
8. 							Guy, you are talking about people who literally raped animals to death.  You don't think that is wrong? You don't think it is worth your time to keep people like that out of your conventions, talking to your little cousin or whoever?  Because if that isn't worth policing, you may be part of the problem.  If you would like to inform yourself as to what is going on, listen to [this](https://youtu.be/yzc7UL3VncM) interview with Boneitis by Rackets.  Boneitis was at ground zero when the news broke, and he has strong links to the community. Also, he sounds really sane. He had a first hand view of the evidence that was presented, and he talked to the guy submitting it. Check it out.
9. 								I'm going to check that out now, thanks. Obviously I find the shit disturbing though to be entirely honest, I don't find it surprising. Someone somewhere was bound to be this much of an inbred hick.   To be honest what miffles me about this is the implication that if I'm even tangentially related with that Fandom I'm now under some sort of obligation to go run people through the coals. Even more so when this is framed as this ""big tent"" of a community, while I'm here half a globe across and very clearly not aware of how bad the situation is over there. So yeah, ""stern disapproval and consternation"". Not much else most of us can do, unless there's some sort lobbying campaign going on. 
10. 							> I'm saying what you're calling policing IS THE CANCER.   So, err, once you're part of a fandom you are happy with anyone doing anything? aren't you, like, happy that this fandom exist? i understand where you come from too, i understand that alot of people want to use their free times to have some fun in a nice place and i don't blame them for that, but it's kept fun and nice because there is motherfuckers like me who let their steam off by shredding SJW et all; like you pointed out, we aren't functioning the same way.  I will reiterate too, you need rules to have a nice thing, anarchism will only get you so far, even 4 and 8 chans have moderators to put that into perspective, it's naive for you to imply ""no rules"" is ""best rules"" and i think you see rules as some kind of under the bed monster, while i see them more of ""don't dox people, keep it on subject and related to XXX fandom, no selfpost, don't do any illegal shit and **no** politics""  > Because it takes us to be collectivists  You're on KIA, which is a collective for nerds that got the wrong end of the stick for too long, what did you fucking expect?   > You're advocating for the disease thinking it's the cure  That's your opinion my dude, you may not be interested in the current culture war but the war is interested in you, whatever you like it or not.   > arguing for being fueled by hatred or some shit.   And? is that wrong or something?  > That's self evidently not the way.   Got a load of this guy.  > That's how we become them.  Inaction was what lead us to the current timeline, but what you imply is that there is no nuance, that you're either 100 or 0% of something, no one is bothered by Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook rules, no one, people are pissed because said rules are being enforced whenever Twitter *et all* see it fit their agenda.  
11. 								I don't think what I wrote could be read as advocating for no nuance. I suspect that's just a culture barrier. I don't see how I can explain myself further. Take care, my dude. 
12. 									I'll pinpoint that for you.  > I'm saying what you're calling policing IS THE CANCER.   > you're calling policing  > CANCER  Which directly say policing is cancerous, meaning that it implies you're either in some media wide FFA or in some dystopian dictature, nuance my dude, it's possible to find a middle ground.

","1. Imo That pecker of a vice prez Lyndon ""its my turn to play""  Johnson had the most to win with JFK gone.  He was also pretty much being ignored in most aspects as Bobby was by default everything Johnson wished he was.  The coming election would have seen Johnson replaced,  that was already pretty much well known amongst the people in positions to know.  Together with the constant snubbing and behind the back discussions,  baby Lyndon had had enough.  He would have the resulting clout and the ability to keep any questions suppressed and any evidence perpetually spinning out of reach. He jumped right into the war with more vigor than brains.  Im sure he had his support clique;  with the biggest tit belonging to individuals in the top level of the military and CIA.  Just seeing the war continue afterwards and knowing how useless Johson was (granted through the disdain JFK had for the guy) beforehand leaves if not certain proof then at the least a nice red flag ripe for suspicion.  Sadly as the years go by,  these hard points in history that were questionable from their beginning shed the covers they used and open themselves to much greater scrutiny only to be exposed to a world so changed and so much more complex that their exposure will be staring into the eyes of indifference.

PS: I fully acknowledge nothing was perfect. But it was a wonderful time where people literally did not care what your kink was when you logged into a MUD, MUSH, MUX, MOO or MUCK ... as long as it was consensual and you were a good neighbour.   The same cannot be said today, thanks to people like the Author.

","1. So here's an interesting tidbit in this article:  >At GeekGirlCon this weekend in Seattle, six members of the Dungeons and Dragons team from Wizards of the Coast, the company behind D&D, described efforts to go beyond the stereotypes and appeal to more players, including women, people of color and even middle-schoolers. Each worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition, which launched in 2014.  The paragraph in question doesn't say who the six women are, but later on is a picture of them, underneath which is a caption:  >Members of the Dungeons and Dragons team spoke about their experiences working on the game and its effort to expand into more diverse player groups at GeekGirlCon in Seattle.   It then names each of them: ""Left to right: Jaden Emme, Shelly Mazzanoble, Trish Yochum, Kate Irwin, Liz Schuh, Emi Tanji.""  Okay, fair enough. But I wasn't familiar with most of those names, so I checked LinkedIn for their work profiles, since I was curious what role they'd played in designing D&D Fifth Edition. Here's what I found:  **Jaden Emme:** I couldn't find a listing for her at all, on LinkedIn or anywhere else. I have no idea what her job title is or what role she played in developing D&D 5E.  **Shelly Mazzanoble:** Author of *Confessions of a Part-Time Sorceress*, Shelly's bio on LinkedIn says that she's been an Associate Brand Manager at WotC since 1998, and moved up to (non-Associate) Brand Manager in June of 2017. I'm suspicious of the idea that this involved much actual design or development work.  **Trish Yochum:** According to her LinkedIn profile, Trish Yochum was a Senior Manager of WotC's in-house Graphic Design Group from 2000-2007, after which she apparently left the company for several other jobs as well as a long stint of self-employment. She rejoined Wizards of the Coast as a Graphic Designer in April of 2018.  **Kate Irwin:** Kate Irwin has been an Art Director for Wizards of the Coast since August of 2000. (Presumably this involved D&D and Magic: the Gathering both?)  **Liz Schuh:** Her LinkedIn profile states that Liz Schuh has been Wizards of the Coast's Head of Publishing and Licensing for Dungeons & Dragons since August of 1995. Again, I question how much design and development this job involves.  **Emi Tanji:** Emi Tanji has, according to LinkedIn, been a Senior Graphic Designer for Wizards of the Coast since 2007, and an Art Director for WotC since February of 2018.  So there you have it. Most of the women that were said to have ""worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition"" seem to have been involved with the artwork (which, to be fair, is a perennial hot-button issue for regressives) or were involved with licensing and brand management. At least one (Trish Yochum) doesn't appear to have been involved during the development period at all, unless she was an outside contract. (I don't have my 5E books with me to check.) Either way, aside from issues of the art, this really seems to be stretching the definition of ""involved.""  So slightly more honest than normal for typical games journalism, I suppose.
2. 	Jaden: She was in the beta playtest Shelly/Trish/Kate/Liz/Emi: Marketing and Graphics.  None of these women did a damn bit for rules creation and design.  They drew pretty pictures and sent out flyers and made damn sure other companies knew what was coming down the pipeline.   They had a job, but Rules were not one of them. 
3. 	""even middle schoolers""  Buh?  Isn't that when most people started playing?
4. 	I've got no complaints about the art for 5th edition I've seen, with the exception of the halfling in the PHB.

When the UK was drafting, implementing and enforcing this anti-speech legislation, he was celebrating and calling everyone who didn't like it a retarded bigot.

","1. Suicide is one of the most selfish acts possible.
2. 	so are you advocating for suicide that does not interfere with your morning commute, Nancy?
3. 		I am against suicide.  I am also against people selfishly impacting the lives of thousands of others.
4. 			The wait in traffic of a thousand is not worth the life of one?
5. 				We have a planet choking to death on human pollution, babies born into squalor, people starving to death by the thousands due to inadequate resources.  I just don't give a shit about one person dying by their own hand. I'd rather they didn't do it, but if they have to, don't be a selfish prick about it.  Do you give a fuck for the train driver who runs them over and is left traumatised for their entire life? The kid who finds their body hanging in a park? The policeman investigating a strange smell from next door?  You really are a piece of work if you can claim suicide isn't the most selfish way to die.
6. 					He was jumping off a bridge into water.  No train driver would be affected.  OK.    That said, should emergency 911 services stop servicing these suicide calls?  If they did, that would stop the inconvenience of busy people trying to get to Wal-Mart or work being late by 30 minutes to an hour but would ultimately lead to a higher number of people successful in killing themselves.  Is that what you want?  If so, just say it.  
7. 						You have no sympathy for the drivers who watch people die beneath trains?  What do you want me to say? I think I've been pretty clear.  And how many people use suicide attempts to draw attention to themselves? Invest in a better mental healthcare system is what I say. 
8. 							Look cunt or bitch (whichever applies).  Read the article.  There was no train.    Bridge, water, traffic.  
9. 								Traffic are people that would have seen him jump.  I know people that have seen someone jump off a bridge, it can seriously affect you.  It is actually qute selfish to commit suicide in front of everyone because it's almost an emotional way of trying to take people with you. It is also quite selfish because it impacts everyone else that you left behind; family and friends who may have really cared about you and not known you were suicidal will go through their lives thinking they didnt do enough when in fact they might have been the only thing holding you together that long.  Suicide is selfish because it hurts those who care about you or the unlucky few who witness it. The more they loved you, the more they are impacted.
10. 									Bull fucking shit.  How many subs are on this dumb website that show people dying, getting seriously injured etc.  It might affect someone for about 20 minutes, until they loo back at their phone and forget about it. 
11. 										That's a very bleak and untrue thought. People can get over seeing a death on a screen, we see them all the time, fake or not. Not deaths in person.
12. 								Look dude... The train reference is an example... We know there was no train...  The example given is to let you understand that if you ever decide to take your life it's really selfish of you to do so in a way that inconvenience and traumatize other people...  Like not parking your car and creating a traffic mess or jumping on the train rails...  These women deserved to be tossed too though. Telling him to jump just because of their inconvenience is another level of assholery.
13. 								You should find a bridge and do a flip, faggot.
14. 								You seem very emotionally invested in this subject - perhaps you should seek counselling.  People commit suicide in many many ways. Almost all result in trauma to the person finding the body or witnessing the death. I was using a train suicide as a visualisation tool, but you seem not to have realised that. I'm sorry I can't help you further.
15. 									ok.  
16. 								You don't get it..
17. 								Which woman in your life hurt you? You come off as desperately needing to put these women down. Not even a great story to pick. Pretty fucking pathetic.

I mean, not that women can’t have muscles and a strong jawline, I have a pretty prominent jaw as a woman, but estrogen/testosterone does affect how you gain muscle and the fat distribution on your body.

I think many of these people chose not to get help when they were of sounder mind, and should be punished for the exact same reasons.

I think the definition of ""mentally ill"" is far too loose, and many of them should and could have gotten help to relieve it before it got to a point of becoming criminally dangerous.  is that the fault of the sick person or the people around them?  because, for example, some schizophrenics aren’t aware they’re schizophrenic and episodes featuring visions that don’t actually exist are quite real to them.  they can’t tell the difference between their illness and reality.  >After all, you don't get off of drunk driving because you were too drunk to make a rational decision.    likewise, mentally ill people that commit crimes are held accountable for them, sometimes with a measure of leniency that accounts for their illness.  drinking and driving is not the same though.  if someone is sufficiently mentally ill and fall off their meds, they can’t tell they have.  and this doesn’t mean they see pink elephants that night, it’s a slow spiral until they do, and by that time pink elephants make total sense.    these kinds of lapses are ameliorated because what they suffer from is permanent and clouds judgment beyond what alcohol does.  they didn’t choose to go and drink/see elephants, they were born with it.    likewise personal responsibility while drunk is much more important because you choose how much to drink, how drunk you get, and then drive and hit someone.  >You get put in jail because you chose to drink and left yourself a means to drive.  I think many of these people chose not to get help when they were of sounder mind, and should be punished for the exact same reasons.  mental illness is still a deeply taboo subject, and plenty of people prefer to avoid inpatient psychiatric wards because, let’s be real, those places are hell on earth.  that and there are lasting complications from diagnoses.  even if you take your meds regularly and have never had problems, nearly every employer will probably turn you down from a job because of the diagnosis, even though you’ve never had an insane episode and have a perfect record.  it’s understandable that people are sometimes unable to be aware that they aren’t taking medication, and are mostly rejected by society for a flaw in how they were born.  you don’t blame a dog for peeing on the carpet when it’s only ever peed on carpets - that’s it’s whole experience and all it knows.  you understand where the dog comes from and work with it to achieve a better result.  as i’ve already said, this doesn’t excuse the crimes committed, and they do receive punishment for it.  but downplaying actual mental illness or saying that people choose to be mentally is just fucked.
7. 			I agree, especially with the increasing numbers of people who are put temporarily as wards of the state in a mental institution.  We don't have the psych facilities to properly treat people.  If she's been in-remand? She's probably part of the now revolving door mentally ill system.   Ends time in psych facility, is on medication, drops off in 2-4 weeks, gets picked up in public for doing batshit crazy thing, put into temporary psychward at a hospital, remand until court.  Court orders back to facility, rinse and repeat.

","1. 'NPC' is the new 'Wake up, sheeple!'. Cringe.  Edit: lol, this had +7 votes like an hour ago. I guess some people are mad that their slogan du jour is actually an object of ridicule on most of the internet
2. 	Yeah, it's pretty funny honestly given how ironic it is for a people to all use the same meme to challenge conformity of ideas. I think some people on twitter did get offended by the meme, but I think pretty much anyone who is using teh term NPC unironically is doing more to harm their own stance than anyone else's. What was wrong with just calling people SJWs?
3. 		It’s being used because of the extreme overreactions of the NPCs it mocks. 
4. 			See, I don't think that's a good look though, since most people just think it's an indicator of mild retardation to use the meme. Maybe a very small percentage of twitter warriors are indeed triggered, but most people just dgaf if someone calls them an NPC. It implies that the user of the meme think they are the Dovahkiin or some shit. It's cringeworthy and borderline teleporting behind you.
5. 				The thing is, the people being called NPCs *already* think we're stupid. This makes no difference.

10. 				> implies that the user of the meme think they are the Dovahkiin or some shit.  I believe it actually means they have agency, as opposed to the person they are identifying as a non-player in the political environment.   But who am I to say? I'm centrist and rational, don't let it get in the way of your righteous wank. 
11. 					Haha what? You think calling someone an NPC is a display of ""agency"" and you think I am the one being self righteous in calling it gormless and laughably limp?  C'mon guy, it's fedora tippery.
12. 						It's not a display of agency, please read before replying. It's a statement that one side believes it has agency while the other does not/does not use it, which is completely different.  ""I am a 12-foot tall multicolored quetzalcoatlus from the pliocene era owed three dollars and fifty cents by a local black chef"" has a huge number of falsities to it (they weren't that size, were mostly monochromatic, aren't modern, and in their prime were cretaceous, not pliocene, and own no accounts receivable from chefs or otherwise), but it can still be stated aloud. And stating it is not ""displaying"" that I am indeed some dino-bird, words are not evidence.   It's fedora-tippy, but so is ""god doesn't exist"". That's not displaying god's lack of existence, it's a statement concerning his (non-)existence. And just like that statement, no one is expecting anyone else to be convinced by saying it, because it isn't an argument, it isn't a display of proof, it's just something they're doing to rouse replies in those they dislike. 
13. 							Quite a lot of semantics to say nothing at all there.  Calling people NPC makes you look like a moron. Change my mind. 
14. 								Well that's a completely different argument, and now that's an opinion based on perception, not a statement of fact, so changing your mind would be quite impractical. 
15. 									Bro. Read the first thing I wrote and your reply. I'm not the one changing my tune here Mr. ""Self Righteous Wank"".   Calling someone an NPC is implying that you are the main character AND that is gormless and flacid like your attempts at sounding intelligent in your replies.

3. 		It's so retarded. Fucking Abe's Lib-Dem has already been accepting Asian immigrants at an unprecedented rate of 350,000-500,000/year without any constitutional/legal/political reforms to prepare for it. The result is they bring more and more of their families in here to put them on benefits funded by our tax money that they don't have to pay. Oh, and we pay for foreign student scholarships that don't need reimbursements too. I don't feel like pulling up references but there are estimates that the indigenous Japanese will be a minority in 50-100 years as it is. No, I'm not necessarily a racial purist but I'm just saying we have no room for any more reckless immigrant acceptance to leech off our already struggling economy. We only need those who enrich our nation, not leeches.

8. 							There was lots of resistance in the us in the early 1900s and the 1960s. In the 1900s they made that statue of liberty plaque, made plays describing america as a melting pot. Heck they changed us from ""A nation of Pioneers"" to ""A nation of Immigrants"" to get the pill down the first time. In 1965 it was only allowed because they assured the native populace it wouldn't drastically alter the demographics.  I can't speak for Europe.

Gays, straights, lesbians, bisexuals, got it. I even get the people with bad body dysmorphia who went to series of psychiatrists and got hormones and surgery as soon as they could. My cousin was like that. I remember her being angry that she was a girl when she was six.  Now we have transgender and gender queer.  I still don't understand what a genderqueer is and why I'm now being forced to diagram out someone's sexual or gender orientation.   Tell me if I'm wrong (and yes, I know I'm posting in pussy pass)...so a genderqueer would be a woman who maybe doesn't want to take hormones, but dresses like a man, thinks she is gay, and dates men?

Sorry for the long post, but I'm honestly getting confused.
2. 	they do not identify as a man or a woman. its nothing to do with sexuality, but self identification. the person you described (a woman who maybe doesn't want to take hormones, but dresses like a man, thinks she is gay, and dates men) could still possibly identify as a man, a woman, or neither. for example, a birthed female who identifies as them, could be solely interested in men

2. 	I think a serious anti-trust regulation is in order.  There were killers who posted on Facebook, Youtube and Twitter before.  Singling out Gab is tortious interference and should be punished.
3. 		I thought we were supposed to celebrate the free market working as intended?
4. 			Anti-trust protects the free market. This isn’t a gotcha. Stop being retarded.
5. 			In case you're retarded instead of an actual lying shill:  large companies ganging up on their competition to ensure that nobody can compete is called a cartel, not a free market.
6. 	The first amendment should apply to free speech on the internet. Private companies should not have the right to censor public speech. Public social networks should have no right or power to censor you on their networks as long as those networks are private (all content is written by the network themselves). The idea that they are 'private' corporations is ridiculous. Not one of these major tech giants doesn't have government influence. When the government started giving them warrants for their data they ceased to be public. The government cannot use a proxy to breach the 1st amendment.   &#x200B;  That is the only solution to this. Censorship on the internet is getting out of hand. Net Neutrality was a sham. It isn't where censorship is coming from. It's just a shitton of regulations and red tape preventing a mesh network from taking hold...making it so only massive ISPs can jump through all the legal hoops to exist in the first place. So they can't throttle your ports. Who gives a shit.   &#x200B;  Google and Facebook have AI's more advanced than most governments military scouring through your every action turning you into a node for their massive AI brain. The goal is to manipulate public behaviour. They are controlled not by private individuals, but by individuals in positions of political power. They cannot be distinguished from government. In many ways, they are more government than government.   &#x200B;  Paypal, Mastercard and Visa refuse to let you process payments. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple...all gang up against you. No ads, no apps, no search results. Manipulating search results against you...this is the real censorship.  All the damn NPCs are just spinning their wheels because they were programmed to. But they never had a solid argument. They never cared or saw what was actually happening.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;
7. 		>The first amendment should apply to free speech on the internet. Private companies should not have the right to censor public speech.   Censorship is certainly getting out of hand, but I don't agree with this either.  It makes perfect sense to me that if a platform doesn't want to allow dick pics or people spamming NIGGERFAGGOT all day, that platform should be allowed to do that. If a platform about discussing basketball wants to block/lock/ban non-basketball related discussion, they should be allowed to do that.   And yes, I know that sounds like it leads to the censorship problem we have now, and no I don't have an answer.  
8. 			Yes, it's a complicated one. I think the main argument that people make is that when social media companies become so large that they have control over a significant proportion of speech online and are actually massive political influencers, that different rules should apply - that they should be considered more like telephone companies.  I don't think anyone who matters is actually arguing that some random forum shouldn't be allowed to ban trolls.
9. 				For me the line was crossed when companies that have nothing to do with social media stepped in.  OK, Twitter wants to be a bunch of faggots; fine.  Some other place where people are allowed to speak their minds will step up and give Twitter some competition.  Twitter annoyed me, but I wasn't in the ""Somebody needs to step in!!"" camp.  So I think I even disagree with you that a huge social media company shouldn't be allowed to act like Facebook and Twitter.   But now that credit card companies, payment processors, web hosts, search engines and cell phone manufacturers are all working together to *ensure* nobody can differ meaningfully from Twitter's formula...that's where I have a problem. 
10. 					It’s essentially the mirror image of vertical integration. A phone manufacturer creates a product with an intentional feature gap so that another company (one they conveniently own...) can sell you the “solution”. Except in this case, the social media platform is denying political speech (at the behest of their ideological leaders) and then leaning on payment processors and registrars to destroy anyone else who might provide the competing product the market needs.  Then leftists imagine themselves clever for insisting this is “your beloved free market in action lol”, which sort of gives up the grift that they are anything about marxists.
11. 			If they want to be protected by the Safe Harbor protections, they should, sure as shit, allow “NIGGERFAGGOT” all day, and all night.  They can’t claim they are a utility under Safe Harbor, and then behave as a publisher & editor.  Those are two incompatible positions.
12. 				Seems like an obvious case, but Congress isn’t playing ball. I’m guessing they’re getting a lot of money from the likes of soros to keep well out of social media interference until after the midterms. It’s so fucking important that republicans keep the house. Only way we will ever see this issue addressed.
13. 			Yes, but at the same time, do you want to have to pass a Chinese-style Social Credits check whenever you use a company's services?  
14. 			You’re describing gatekeeping, which was never an objective evil.  What we need to do is listen to Vox Day, unfortunately: build our own payment processors and domain registrars and every other ounce of infrastructure required, and then we need to ruthlessly gatekeep all of them in order to prevent leftist entryism.
15. 				and once again the cryptoanarchists are proven right.  I'd like them to be wrong at least once.
16. 			The problem is deeper and more complex than you understand. Pornography is not legal in public, and attacking a network with spam is not legal either. Keeping discussion on topic by moderators is arguably the only purpose of moderators that isn't a breach of power.  However, that is not what is happening. What is happening is that on topic discussions, that do not have any resemblance of spam or pornographic (or otherwise) content are censored because they do not fit a political narrative.   Therefore, only one particular viewpoint can be presented. This causes new and naive users to only see one particular point of view. If that point of view is not correct, and if that is not in their best interest, they will inevitably be harmed by it.   Understanding of social psychology, and utilization of big data allows a more comprehensive attack to take place, directing the knowledge and understanding of entire groups of people to a political aim.   This is extremely dangerous in a democracy where successful manipulation of the majority of the vote is tantamount to turning any democracy into a dictatorship. 
17. 			in the basketball scenario, that's fine because the idea is you can have a separate forum for any special interest

","1. What a terrible shame.... LOL.  I think it's retarded that people can be warned by the police over tweets, I mean, it's not like he was making serious threats to kill someone or anything, but the schadenfreude is strong on this one. This guy is such a cunt that I can't help but point and laugh on this occasion.
2. 	The man argued very fervently in favour of speech being a crime that requires police intervention. I am horribly concerned this sort of thing is still a crime in the UK, but as far as I see it Mr. Linehan should be happy he's got what he wanted.
3. 		People who believe in anti-speech laws should feel the full brunt of them.
4. 			Hilarious as that is, those anti speech laws are still there after we've all had a good laugh at a moron being kicked in the arse with them. They're a tool to control discourse and ideas with the full force of the criminal justice system; it was wrong when they were used on Dankula and it's wrong now, no matter whether we hate the guy or not. Have a moment of schadefreude, sure, but remember what this represents.
5. 				It represents the people who put these stupid rules in place and support these rules learning why they're fucking retarded. And hopefully them opposing the rules since, surprise, they apply to them too.   Sometimes people only start to realize why something is bad when they are personally affected by it. If they are immune, or feel immune, they don't care. Which is why we're in this position. 
6. 					One of the best ways to overturn bad laws or rules is to make sure they are enforced fully against everyone at all times.
7. 				We want him to be redpilled.  Probably won't happen, but here's for hoping.  He's obviously protected his tweets out of fear, so deep down, he probably agrees with us.
8. 					Personally, I'd settle for him just simply toning it down a bit. Admitting that going full-bore ""woke"" is a terrible thing to do. That there are some fundamental issues the social justice crowd are putting their weight behind that are stupendously bad ideas.
9. 						He probably won't.  He's too stupid for that.  He'll delete his Twitter before that happens.

","1. They should make comedy illegal.  (I joke, just comedy that isn't given the seal of political approval.)
2. 	You say that, but I actually had somebody try to chastise me for listening to Bill Burr's podcast because he's ""right wing"".
3. 		It's a joke that's so close to reality you don't know whether to laugh or cry.
4. 			Well, you know that Hannah Gadsby?  The awful lesbian who did the ""I got raped"" stuff in her special, and was given a shitload of awards, despite the special not being funny?  Well, she actually said ""If you're a comedian and only want to make people laugh, then get off the stage, and let somebody use the platform!""  That's literally the point of being a comedian, to make people laugh.  There's a british comedian I like called Rob Beckett, he was promoting his forthcoming tour, and actually said ""There's nothing about Trump, or Brexit, or any of that political stuff, I'm just letting people get away for a couple of hours, and have fun.""  It's sad that a comedian has to say ""I'm here to make you laugh"", and other comedians saying ""If you're just trying to make people laugh, you're not doing your job!""
5. 				Is that the Nanette thing or whatever it’s called?   Do you listen to the Cum Town podcast? The guy from there, Nick Mullen, called out how it’s insane to dictate to someone what they should talk about. If your concern is to further some cause before being funny then that’s not stand up. Maybe it’s theatre or something but if you can’t figure out how to make something funny then don’t call it stand up.  I’m guessing from your username you’re into O and A, I wish Patrice was around now because he’d shred this nonsense.   It’s not even that long ago but can you imagine Tropic Thunder being made today? The outrage at Robert Downy Junior blacking up (even though that’s the point) would be insane.  
6. 					Yeah, It's ""Nanette"".  I keep on meaning to listen to Cum Town, but Nick Mullen hits it on the head, it's not for people like her to say ""If you're a comedian and you only want to make people laugh, then get off the stage!"" well, in response to that, I say, if you're promoting a stand up comedy show, and in turn, you wish to give a Feminst TED Talk, then you should vacate the stage, because I'm there for funny people.  Every single time shit like this comes up, I wish Patrice was around for it.  The amazing thing is, that clip of him making that Feminist look stupid is so relevant today.  Funny you mention Tropic Thunder, you know the guy who made that Apu documentary?  Well, he actually bitched about Tropic Thunder doing that, when asked if he felt the same about White Chicks, he was suspiciously quiet.
7. 						The Patrice clip seems more relevant as time goes on. The woman who kept on talking about “the nation” speaking is exactly the same type of mentality as the woman saying comedians have to talk about serious topics and that outrage culture that goes along with it.  Imagine if a comic tried to dictate to her and say you shouldn’t talk about x and the hypocritical outrage that would happen over that. Didn’t know about the Apu documentary guy but it’s exactly the same thing. If you have to hold a double standard in a position you take then why should anyone listen? Of course if it’s one rule for you and another rule for everyone else that’s instantly going to mean people dismiss you.   It’s just the hypocrisy that I find baffling. The types who say they hate straight white men and then complain about racism and sexism won’t admit they’re a different side of the same coin. People will call out white separatists and then say that safe spaces that exclude white people are fine. They’re either both equally abhorrent or acceptable or you’re a hypocrite.  Are there any comics you’d recommend listening to at the moment?  I think if you like O and A you’ll like Cum Town/Nick Mullen. There’s not much of his standup around but just chatting shit on a podcast there aren’t many funnier people I’ve heard. Recommend Kurt Metzger and Million Dollar Extreme too. Metzger did Race Wars podcast with Sherrod Small but I find the guy insufferable to listen to. For silly laughs I like Nate Bargatze too. There’s lots of comedy albums on Spotify which I’ve only recently discovered were on there 
8. 							Yeah, the term she used that always stuck with me was that Opie & Anthony had ""Violent images towards women""... it's a radio show.  I remember that Bearing video where he talked about Hannah Gadsby, and there was the part where a guy was at her show and said ""Are there gonna be any jokes in this?"", and she got security to kick him out, saying ""I don't want you here, I'll donate your ticket money to a women's shelter"".  It's a perfectly valid thing to ask, you think you're going to a stand up comedy show, and instead you're greeted with what is essentially that ""play"" in Friends where the woman scream ""Why don't you like me?!""  As for the comics, I'm British, and none really match up to the ""O&A"" vibe, but maybe give Steve Hughes a try, he did an amazing Anti-PC bit a few years ago.  But a lot of our comics are very safe, but can be funny.  I'm really enjoying Gregg Davies (who, ironically enough is in The Inbetweeners).  But, I've enjoyed:  - Gregg Davies - Sean Lock - Rob Beckett - John Bishop - Jason Manford - Mick Ferry - Mickey Flanaghan  But, like I said you might not like them, because, right now, the british comedy scene seems to be very safe, very ""Only these people are allowed to be targetted"".  I love that you brought up Sherrod, that ""Dassabesso"" clip will always be funny.

If you feel the need to infantilize women, please go back to the 1950's when they weren't responsible for their own sexual behavior.

And the demonizing of The Enlightenment. I'm sure she would have loved living under the Catholic church in the middle ages or in John Calvin's Geneva. Humanity breaking free of religious dogma was basically the best thing that ever happened to women in the West for over 1000 years.

","1. This isn't a pussypass... The guy was in the wrong and the woman could arguably be defending their property.   Just because the mother stole the parking space doesn't make him thrashing their car like an overgrown toddler right, and neither does it make beating the crap out of her in response to the punch (the law allows you to defend yourself, but only in the same capacity as they escalate it; bashing her head against another car gratuitously exceeds that threshold.  Another example would be like pulling a knife and stabbing someone who slapped you once)
2. 	You cannot say she was defending her property as he walked away immediately after kicking their vehicle.  Any action taken, after that point, is a completely separate incident and would need to be justified independently of the vehicle kick.  It's like if someone punched you, then began walking away. You aren't defending yourself if you just to attack their back as the threat has already ceased and is actively creating distance, thereby progressively diminishing any possibility of a future threat rapidly.
3. 		Regardless, how is this a pussypass?  Both the people featured in this video are cunts (regardless of whether or not they possess a biological one), and both deserve to face the consequences of their actions.
4. 			Agreed. My only point was that it was not in defense of anything, whether it be herself or her property.  But, at the same time, him hitting her back as excessively (my own perception) as he did was equally unnecessary. His position is entirely impossible to justify. He could claim that he felt threatened when she approached, then struck him, and needed to defend himself. However, once the threat was clearly stopped, he should have reassessed. 
5. 				Exactly why this isn't a pussy pass.  This is another example of how some people clearly don't read the rules for this sub before posting. edit: see here ""Any post that shows physical force against a woman that wasn’t instigated or excessive retaliation to instigation will be removed.

Ironically while you are making fun of black people under the impression that there is no racisim and they are whining you are showing racisim by generalizing and degrading a group based on stereotypes you assume to be true. I've seen Nazis on TV , I've seen the KKK on TV, I've seen White people call the cops over the most riddicilus reasons , am I to assume that this applies to all white people or am I meant to have the educated assumption that , they are the exceptions not the rule, unfortunately you do not see your hyprocrisy, so go ahead and scream how people of color have it to good and shouldn't complain while you prove the point the SJWs are attempting to make with your hyprocrisy.

","1. Vibrators don't consent but they don't also look and act exactly like a sentient being.  People in this thread are making fun of the guy saying ""sex robots are a red flag"" but this is already the justification used to ban simulated/photoshopped child pornography (defined as photos of actual children made into porn, not talking about drawn or 3D child porn which is a murkier issue)  No children are harmed in making fake child porn, but it is still banned under the arguments that a) can be used to teach real children b) creates a market and audience that might then escalate to real child porn. Conversely, some argue that fake child porn could be an outlet that prevents someone else from harming a real child because they can ""safely"" live out a harmful fantasy.  In the same way, an argument could be made that someone who gets off on raping sex robots could be just practicing and then feel emboldened enough to try the real thing. Or they could be using it as a safe outlet.  It's a complicated issue and both sides have valid points so I don't think either side deserves to be mocked.  
2. 	""In the same way, an argument could be made that someone who gets off on raping sex robots could be just practicing and then feel emboldened enough to try the real thing.""   You can't rape an inanimate object you retarded fuck.
3. 		> You can't rape an inanimate object you retarded fuck.  You have trouble with basic English literacy, so I'll repeat:  > Vibrators don't consent but they don't also look and act exactly like a sentient being  The point is the simulation, not the sci-fi issue of robot consent.  You can program a sex robot to scream out in pain/terror, cry ""No no no, please top"", try to fight back, etc.  With a sex robot, you could simulate the rape act perfectly, to the point that if you were to film that act then it would be indistinguishable from filming a real rape.  Just like if the sex robot were a child then ""inanimate object"" or not, filming it would be as illegal under existing child porn laws.  This is all worlds away from sticking a non-responsive inanimate object in your pussy.  And if you can't see the difference, then you've already established who the retarded fuck is.  
4. 			""With a sex robot, you could simulate the rape act perfectly, to the point that if you were to film that act then it would be indistinguishable from filming a real rape.""  So then why would someone rape a real person if its so indistinguishable? And there is already rape fantasy porn so who cares  if it's not real? And I doubt they would make child sex robots so that point is irrelevant. I feel that a potential rapist could get his fix on a robot instead of a real person so that could lead to less rape, not more. And news flash most rapists rape because they can't get any, a problem sex robots will solve. so yea you are still the retarded fuck here.
5. 				> So then why would someone rape a real person if its so indistinguishable?  Just because it looks/appears indistinguishable doesn't mean it feels that way to the perpetrator.  They know it isn't real.  Escalation is an established part of sexual crimes.  Neither science nor law is able to currently draw a line between ""healthy outlet"" and ""practice for the real thing"" and sex robots only blur this line further.  > And there is already rape fantasy porn so who cares if it's not real?  Rape porn is illegal.  Yes, there are plenty of videos on the Internet but none of those are US Title 18 compliant so technically illegal. Sex robots, presumably, would be a the first legal ""outlet"" for rape fetishists.  > And I doubt they would make child sex robots so that point is irrelevant  Something isn't irrelevant just because you proclaim it so.  Why wouldn't they make rapeable child sex robots? Or toddlers? Or infants?  They are just ""inanimate objects"" to you.  Why do you think sex robots will be limited to only the fetishes that you personally support like rape?  > I feel that a potential rapist could get his fix on a robot instead of a real person so that could lead to less rape, not more  Again, escalation is how every pathological sexual behavior plays out.  Your ignorant opinions mean jack shit.  > And news flash most rapists rape because they can't get any, a problem sex robots will solve. so yea you are still the retarded fuck here.  Or they make it worse by letting them practice for the real thing.  It's clear you aren't capable of understanding basic reasoning so I'm done trying to explain things to a shit-for-brains incel.

","1. For a supposed patriarchal society this ""humour"" about women slapping and hitting men is all pervasive, TV shows and movies that celebrate a woman slapping or hitting a man who has displeased her is pretty much endemic now and the reaction is to just laugh or say ""right on girl he deserved it""    The double standard sickens me  Edit: spelling, I can't spell patriarchal
2. 	Patriarchy doesn't mean ""beneficial for men and detrimental for women"". It's damaging for men as well, traditional gender roles are the reason people are laughing at this guy.
3. 		Exactly. It's the same reason the term ""man flu"" exists - the idea that men complain more when sick and are less resilient than women when it comes to being ill, despite the fact that statistically women take more sick leave than men. It's because under the ""patriarchy"" or ""toxic masculinity"" of our society, men are expected to be stoic and tough, and any sort of indication of weakness is met with derision. 
4. 			I feel like I read somewhere that the man flu is a real thing though. My memory might not be spot on here but I think it said something along the lines of this; the virus recognizes that male hosts can not reproduce and as such doesn't value the host as much and doesn't hold back from the affliction. Whereas with female hosts it holds back because they are needed to reproduce and create more hosts.  I don't know how much truth there is to that though, but I did read it somewhere and thought it was cool.
5. 				If you could find a credible source that would be an amazing read. Unfortunately due to how it's worded it sounds suspicious but you're half remembering an article you read a while ago so it's not your fault at all.  Anyways, if there's a source I'd love to read it!

This is the sort of stupid shit that only someone who spends their day thinking about stupid shit like toxic masculinity/patriarchy theory could possibly think is true. Stoicism and toughness are celebrated, but that does not mean *all* weakness is met with derision.  Emotional passion and tenderness are generally liked in men too. Have you ever thought about *why* things like stoicism and strength among men are celebrated and encouraged? Do you not realize it's a good thing? That we are all alive and living the way we are now thanks to the sacrifices our forebearers made?  Sometimes, some people go overboard. Like those bitches on the Talk who laughed at a woman cutting her husband's dick off. Funny how the male gender is blamed for women like that behaving like cunts.

","1. I doubt that this writer have much knowledge of some the anime brought up in this article.  >The long-running series Mobile Suit Gundam, known for constantly reinventing itself since the late 1970s, almost always features an antagonistic sovereign state based on a jingoistic, WWII-era Germany.  Sure Zeon and its follow ups are inspired by WWII-era Germany but otherwise most series lacks such states. You could maybe make case of SEED's ZAFT being such a case due to taking heavy inspiration from MSG Zeon but it also have some differences that make such claims harder to make. Gundam X's Space Revolutionary Army could be stretched to maybe fit due to again taking inspiration from Zeon but the series don't really focus much time on that faction so it's hard to know.  I don't think you find such state in G, Wing, Turn A or 00, maybe cases could be made for AGE, Reconguista in G or Iron-Blooded Orphans I haven't completed them so I don't know but even if so that still plenty of series that lack such states which makes saying ""almost always"" a bit much.    >Legend of the Galactic Heroes, a Japanese novel series adapted into multiple anime shows, also contains a similar government called the Galactic Empire.  I wouldn't say the Galactic Empire is primarily inspired by a WWII-era Germany but rather 19 century Prussia or the German Empire with the focus on how important nobility is to advance in the ranks of the Galactic Empire.     >Hetalia: Axis Powers portrays a group of anthropomorphized countries with a sympathetic, long-suffering Germany as the main character.   I think saying Germany is the main character is kinda disingenuous, saying that Germany is a main character is totally fine but the only one that really can qualify as the main character is Italy.       
2. 	For sure they accused shokugeki no souma of facisim because the school is the top in Japan and its requirements are strict and there's some students that home their craft in a very traditional way.  The main character bucks those trends and is very much an individual forging their own path, so much so that he inspires everyone around them to pursue their own way.  They had a go at strike witches; an anime with pantless teenage girls fighting aliens in alternate www2.  FMA:B not even going to break this one down, the author is just a retard.

2. 	Wow, that's a lot of hate!   Let me guess, some trans person stole your sweetroll? 
3. 		Lol! Nah, just hate people who don't understand basic biology. I want to be a spoon, can I magically change that? Just such a stupid mentality. 
4. 			Ah yes, wishing death to everyone, without a proper education and everyone under the age of like 8, sounds reasonable.  And also, please explain this ""basic biology"" to me please. What exactly defines gender? And why are trans people the way they are?  Edit:typo
5. 				It's actually people who don't have the intelligence to tell whether they are male or female. Fuck them. Kids have a gender, they were born with it.  Well chromosomes define your gender, don't even think about going down the 'that defines your sex' route. It is total nonsense and you will sound like a moron. They are like that simply because they are idiots who haven't the faintest idea what real life is like.
6. 					 Chromosomes sound nice at first, but are really wierd and seem to do what they want when you learn more about them than your 8.grade ""basic biology"". A quick look at Wikipedia gives 14 sex chromosome disorders, including things like: Having 2x and 1x1y at the same time. Having xy in some cells and xx in others. And having xy chromosomes but still be a woman, because your body can't react to testosterone (and vice versa). Do you really think that those people are men? And then again, can you even explain how chromosomes control the sexual development? 
7. 						I have done research through some wiki. It doesn't actually give any disorders, only stating that sometimes mutations happen such as the vary small minority of people with both genitals. That's it. If you have xy then yes, you are indeed a man, that's a scientific fact. Well there's where you shot yourself, obviously looking at parts you want to believe and leaving out the bits you don't agree with. The XY sex-determination system is the sex-determination system found in humans, most other mammals, some insects (Drosophila), some snakes, and some plants (Ginkgo). In this system, the sex of an individual is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes. There you go, hope that clears it up. Maybe you should do some research next time...
8. 							I was literaly just reading from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_chromosome_disorders for my comment. With ""Having 2x and 1x1y at the same time."" i meant the XXXY sysndrome With ""Having xy in some cells and xx in others."" u meant the 45,X/46,XY mosaicism With ""having xy chromosomes but still be a woman"" i meant the XY gonadal dysgenesis and with ""(and vice versa)"" i was referring to the ""XX male syndrome"" syndrome.  You can find all of those on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_chromosome_disorders. Or you could have googled ""Sex chromosome disorders"" and used the first result.  Can you now please awnser my questions instead of accusing me for bad research, because of your own bad research? :)
9. 								You are aware these are very, very rare and don't relate to these idiots that say they are born in the wrong body? They are genetic mutations. Also you haven't read some of that correctly as you keep trying to say you can have xy and be a woman... This is incorrect. Xy is only ever going to be male. I also did answer your questions.
10. 									Although, i did read some things wrong, i think the part about having xy and being a woman is not one of them. The Swyer syndrome, or XY gonadal dysgenesis, is a condition, in witch babies with xy chromosomes cant develope testicles, and thus get female characteristics. They then get born with those characterristics and live as women for their entire live. I would say that those people are, without a doubt female. Please read the article for more information about it.  The reason i brought this topic up, is to show that chromosomes cant always be used to define the gender of someone, and can be really wierd overall.  I didnt ask you IF sex is determined by chromosomes. I asked you HOW that works. The exact process how the chromosomes controll every aspect of sexual development in humans.
11. 										That doesn't make them female... yes they are! In fact the disorders can provide evidence for that. Actually research it, I sent you a cut of wiki for that. It's all there.

2. 	>A private company's obligation is to shareholder value, not peoples feelings about themselves.  I used to believe that. (insert clip of Molymeme doing his standard *""corporations are legally required to avoid waste and maximize profit.""* rant here) But when I saw Intel give $300 million to retarded feminists I just couldn't pretend anymore.   A private company's obligation is to the shareholder's *agenda*, but that doesn't necessarily mean value or profit. Spoiler: The shareholders are giant banks and their agenda is globalism.  >Only the CBC can get away with ignoring economics.  The whole financial system gets away with ignoring economics. Look at Twitter's numbers or our dudeweedstock bubble; global 'markets' are a debt-fueled farce. The cherry on top is millions of people wasting time and energy by solving meaningless math problems with rigs full of overpriced video cards because somehow that's going to ""stahp teh central banksters."" 
3. 		""A private company's obligation is to the shareholder's agenda, but that doesn't necessarily mean value or profit. "" Interesting pov, thanks. Shareholders could indeed have an agenda against their own financial interests (cf. 'Moral' stocks). I suppose more generally companies could have a financial interest in being 'seen' to care about [topic] as a marketing tool, roundaboutly coming back to share value. As a non-economist I find it quite interesting.

4. 			Its really difficult in a fight to only throw one punch. Especially if you've had any kind of fight training. Cause they train you to keep on the opponent until the fight is over or they can't move. 
5. 				We were taught that the fight is over when the opponent is fully incapacitated. That means either they are unconscious or have broken limbs and can no longer perpetrate violence.
6. 					My wager is you are an American 
7. 						I assume from the structure of your comment that you are not an American. 
8. 							I am an American, but the police forces with that mentality are (allow me to generalize) predominantly not western European. 
9. 								I am not a police officer. I am a private citizen who happens to have studied some martial arts.  My instructors were very serious people. They were also very moral people.  You do everything in your power to avoid a fight. Even running away if you have to. But, when your best choice or your only choice is to fight, you prosecute the engagement with extreme violence of action. 
10. 									you're obviously an American, what you learn is bullshit, and you're stupid enough to believe it.  let me explain something to you; many people in many countries hold people like you in contempt.  think of a goat fucker.  an uneducated shepherd in Asia who fucks goats.  how backwards and ignorant they are.  this is how people in Canada and Western Europe view you.  what you believe is wrong, what you're asserting is wrong, and not only is it wrong, it's dangerous.    another thing about americans is they don't win fights.  the last fight america won they withdrew after 1 month.  when you pursue the full violence of action you end up doing far more harm than good and ending up in an 8 year long insurgency that you cut and run from leaving the country to end up in the hands of ISIS.  moderation is paramount in any application of force.  you would know this if you weren't completely ignorant.  you wouldn't be completely ignorant if you didn't go out of your way to be extremely ignorant.  what you're asserting is so ludicrously wrong both morally and practically it makes me angry that anyone is willing, capable, and permitted to spread such vile slander.  i would be extremely surprised if you are over 1.8m.
11. 										When you're so out of touch with reality you equate personal defense training(and basically every martial art in existence endorses the attitude of ""Avoid a fight when possible, end a fight as fast as possible when it does happen"") with full-scale military action.
12. 											it's called making an example people can relate to, retard.
13. 												Except that there's no relation for people to make, and the comparison A) Makes absolutely no sense, and B) is comparing two completely unrelated situations. Your 'example' has nothing to do with the conversation that was going on, as well as being half-incoherent.  You're trying to have a conversation that nobody else is having, and getting SUPER mad about it for no reason, because this situation you're pissed about is 100% in your head. Nobody was talking about America's military actions - except you.
14. 													He specifically mentioned the violence of action.   That's a war on terror term.  2nd invasion of Iraq was war on terror.  First invasion of iraq was not war on terror.  It is both relevant and illustrative.  You're full of shit.
15. 														Okay. I'm sorry you can't seem to read words. He was talking about self-defense and martial arts the entire time, but sure, enjoy your warfighting fetish.
16. 	See, that's just wrong, irrespective of gender. We have been conditioned to defer to cops and to accept wildly disproportionate responses to agitation/response.  The beat down she got was NOT normal in ANY circumstance; she was absolutely being a dick.  Now ask yourself: isn't that exactly what cops are supposed to be able to deal with \- people being dicks?  And our conditioned response is to cheer them on when they instantaneously escalate the situation to 'ultra violence' and swarming at the slighted provocation?  Accepting this anti\-social behavior normalizes it and legitimized this kind of overreaction in cops.  Use of violence should be the *last* resort \- not the first line of defense. 
17. 		What video were you watching?  She put hands on the cops, TWICE.  They escalated perfectly: the first time she did it, she was simply pushed away. The second time (when she punched the cop in the face), she was punched back.  >  isn't that exactly what cops are supposed to be able to deal with  People punching them?  WTF is wrong with you?  Cops have the same right of self-defense as any other human being. 
18. 			Even on PPD we still get the faggoty white knights.     *Accepting this anti\-social behavior normalizes it and legitimized this kind of overreaction in cops.*   The anti social behavior came from the drunk woman, moron.

","1. This arguement does not work (**I agree with the sentiment here, trust me**) because you can put actual shitty subjects into the sentences.   e.g.) *Nazis* are shitty people, fuck all of them.  This is an obvious example, because nazis are shit people. But then we realize that the sentence is not inherently wrong. What is wrong is to generalize a group of diverse people. Nazis are not diverse. White people are.  Just my two cents.
2. 	Nazism is an ideology which can be adopted and abandoned at will, as opposed to an immutable characteristic which cannot be changed. Adherents are fair game, same with Communists. 
3. 		Okay, that's cool and all, but understand that we *can* change the subject of the sentence and have objectively fair and rational statements.
4. 			You can't claim objectivity when discussing questions of sociology, though.  Like, for example, you could have a super hard-core racist write ""niggers are worthless subhuman trash"", and absolutely mean and believe it. Since there isn't any actual ""good"" alignment, or a ""decency"" particle, or ""truth"" waveform, it would be true to the speaker, and ""correct"" as far as their internal worldview is concerned.  We can then say that we disagree with this worldview, and attempt to convert the speaker to our world view, but since we don't have an objective ""truth"" to point to, all we're doing as well is expressing what we consider ""right"" according to our internalized worldviews.  Someone or something with a different morality and different world view would see this from a completely different perspective.

","1. Good post. Watched the video.   What stood out the most was VICE and the way they treated that Chinese tech YouTuber.....totally disrespectful and didn't even care about their informal agreements they made.....this is a company who would seemingly agree that making fun of gay people could result in violence against them, at the same time they release details about this women that could result in her being ostracized by people in her country of China where homosexuality isn't well received.   This is important cause VICE is leading the charge against RDR2 and the whole killing the feminist thing (and against gamers in general) This corporation is evil and degenerate and they are social justice warriors in a place of power and influence. As a community that cares about games and free speech I would expect that we all take militant stances against VICE and never cower or apologize or give in to their mob outrage. These people want more than social justice and we must oppose them with everything we have.   Edit: some of these VICE journalists are literal ANTIFAs as well. Seriously these people in a normal society would get the rope. All of us need to stand in unison against these malicious pieces of shit.   Edit: I guess they didn't overtly out the Chinese woman as gay, but readers can deduce from the article that she was. 
2. 	I asked Koeretzky about this sort of thing, and apparently no journalist is expected to keep such an agreement, he doesn't believe that anything should get in the way of the story, not even the safety of a source. But when we make mean tweets, THAT is what he is against. Aren't journos funny little people? 
3. 		Yeah exactly....they hold themselves to no integrity but expect everyone else to act right.  And this is the ultimate point: they aren't dumb or not self aware....they KNOW what they are doing and they don't care. That's why we have to stand against these people. It may seem like it doesn't matter, but when there's an attack on say the gaming community, we have to support those being attacked even if we don't like them or whatever.   Trump says some dumb shit but he's not wrong in calling the press the enemy of the people. They think we're stupid and easily controlled through social justice outrage campaigns. Fuck all that. 
4. 			> And this is the ultimate point: they aren't dumb or not self aware....they KNOW what they are doing and they don't care.  It’s because there is zero repercussions to being a lying shitbag who is only focused on getting what they want and to hell with everyone else.   This mindset of bare faced lying and cheating to pursue selfish goals and getting away with it is the tumour of society as a whole. Politicians, corporations, governments and journalists have all begun to realise that once you get past a certain point on societies ladder the benefits of lying, cheating and just generally being a cunt always outweigh any consequences if there are any.   To these people things like ethics and morals are a handicap holding everyone else back and the fact that this mindset is being rewarded is just snowballing the problem.   People need to realise that life and society is a game of survival. You get one roll of the dice and these people are going all in, taking and doing whatever they can to get what they want and fuck everyone else. Most ordinary people spend their days being nice to people, caring about the environment or the world their kid will inherit. We understand that there are bad selfish people out there but we have faith in the system of society to have controls in place to limit their influence. That just isn’t happening at all anymore. In fact it feels like the dam has not only burst but is itself completely submerged under an ocean of utter human shit stains.  Thats more of a post than I planned it to be. That bong halfway through maybe wasn‘t the best idea.    Edit - typo
5. 				I love this take so much. Specifically your last point:   Normal people aren't out to destroy the fabric of society and pursue solely selfish goals.   This dovetails into something that dominates me lately, and it's pure anger at these publications, our government, and corporations. They lie to, gaslight, and manipulate normal goodhearted people. That pisses me off to no fucking end, these politicians and journalists are LYING to people daily and have an impact on consciousness.   That's why I love this community. It's a good stand against this type of shit. 
6. 					The majority in any flourishing society must, necessarily, operate within a morality based upon categorical imperative. The average person largely behaves such that, if everyone behaves in the same manner, then society will thrive.  When a critical mass of people cease to behave as such, society quickly degenerates. Then it must either collapse or be rescued by those who would sustain it - and they would face terrible decisions in order to do so.  Incidentally, this is why piracy is wrong.

5. 				> Just reading all the stupidity going on over there and now being able to point out how retarded they were was pissing me off  Pretty much exactly the ridiculousness we're going to face. I guarantee I disagree with most of the people in this sub about so many things, but I also disagree with everyone everywhere about a fuckload of things. I like to consider both sides of every balance, but the illogical reality is that every Yin/Yang argument has the majority of people yelling either White or Black, meanwhile, they're ignorant to the fact that the heart of their own argument is the opposite color.   When people see women as victims constantly deserving support, they're literally falling prey to our evolved desires to support and protect women, and while that's natural and fair, it's normally tied to a lot of freedom from the male side of the equation. As it stands now, men are being demonized, financially damaged, culturally ostracized, and unconditionally hated for being weak. Men are naturally expected to be strong, but society is basically no longer allowing us to do that in many natural ways. We're still demanded to be the assertive pursuers of dating, then the hypergamous reality of women still has them dating up, all while we're being shamed for being ""incels"" like that's somehow new. It should be blatantly considered promotion of ""toxic masculinity"" to *call* people incels, yet it's what's happening culturally. And if you're strong and assertive, you better do it all perfectly in the right way and toward the right person, because otherwise you're going to be seen as a violent predator and demonized for thinking about the thing that caused every fucking one of us to exist.   It's absolute insanity. I'm looking at these internet attitudes mainly, but these hiveminds *will* dictate the future of our culture. We're being trained by shills and plenty of other seamy groups into a state of purely hateful division, and it's disgusting to see this from my perspective as a humanist. All that matters to me is the chance to share a balanced perspective between different arguments, but what's happening? Slowly, my one account, when I'm ""not allowed"" to make alts for risk of being shadowbanned, is being ostracized sub by sub based on the whims of a few people who control the conversation of millions.

","1. Ok so this is really weird   The entire thing about the norwegian flag = Nazi flag thing originates from Germany and east Europe from *after* WW2 as a way for skinheads to get around the 'no Nazi imagery' law a lot of those countries have.   Thing is, it's a *very* European thing. Even to someone living in Norway, it's not normally a thing a ton of people know. I only know about this because of the time my German friend had a party with a few family members from Germany and had a birthday cake which, in the grand norwegian tradition, had a shitton of norwegain flags on it (which raised *a lot* of eyebrows from the Germans there).   So why is this weird?   Because to know the second meaning of the norwegian flag, you need to be either A) from certain parts of Europe or B) be familiar enough with German laws and skinheads to know about how they get around the ""don't wave around a fucking swastika you cunt"" law. And in either situation it would be bizzare that this person would not know *that it's also the fucking norwegian flag* as in A) I would hope someone in Europe would at least vaugely remember the vexiology of their own continent and in B) the use of that flag makes absolutely no sense without any context regarding Norway and Vikings and all that    Also that's less of a halfway house and more of a ""nearly completely rehabilitated and just waiting for the jury to say I'm good"" house.

Or that this person is a fucking retard and genuinely thought ""red, white, and black flag = nazi""?
3. 		I think it's better to assume ignorance then malice. So hopefully they just really didn't know what the flag was
4. 			That one's called Hanlon's razor, in this case all the razors apply it seems.
5. 		It's not even black, it's blue, isn't it?
6. 			Yes,but I can see the mistake being made on a bad or dime screen. Especially if you don’t know what the flag looks like.

I don't like dark skin, even when it's a tan, that doesn't make me racist. I also don't find trans people attractive, doesn't mean I hate them.   Astonishing how simple some things are eh?

10. 	As someone else has said, it's not the same plant, they're cousins sort of? Also, if you want to get into burning things to ""cleanse"" your space, sage is *AWFUL* like puke worthy eyes full of smoke choking awful. It's clearly meant for outdoor use only, IMO. There are so many choices to bring positive happy feelings through scent, why the hell would you use sage when you could go to a candle shop or actually invest in real incense (the kind you burn on charcoal)?

","1. It's anecdotal, but thinking back over my life I find relatively few people who have done this. But the few who have, were women.  Now don't misunderstand or misrepresent that. I'm 55 and have dealt with a LOT of people in my life who *could* have done such a thing. What I'm saying is very few people DID it.  (The fact that those people were women in my case is only pertinent in this sense: I'm sure that that being a low-life cunt who try to steals credit is equally prevalent amongst women and men.)  Now according to the 'article' this is because I'm a man, and that it happens to women a lot more. I submit that it was because when someone did it to me I read them the riot act and stood up for myself. Which is something that women should be able to do given that they have had the freedom to be 'strong independent women' for at least the last 40 years.  So it seems to me that this article is saying that women are weak and unwilling to defend themselves.
