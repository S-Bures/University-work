Name: id, Length: 174, dtype: object","1. I'm not even gonna read that condescending article.  I know for a fact that there were women warriors in the ancient world. I know for a fact that there were women soldiers in newer wars.  I am annoyed of being called dumb by someone who doesn't acknowledge me for what I am - a woman gamer who is more informed than the ""journalist"" who wrote this article.  I would have *loved* to play as a [WASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_Airforce_Service_Pilots) in a WWII game. But no, devs gotta play ""muh diversity"" card because of ignorant dumb sluts that call themselves SJWs. I would have *loved* to see a game focus on strong women like [Tomoe Gozen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen) or [empress Jingu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Jing%C5%AB), if they absolutely must play the No Whites-card. I'm sure there are African warrior women, but I'm not knowledgable when it comes to african nations.  A cunt like Eve MacDonald shouldn't assume anything, when she clearly doesn't know who gamers are. She doesn't even back up her assumption with legitimately historical women fighters.
2. 	Nevermind just the single figures either, but the actual warrior tribes that had women on the front lines or even as the primary fighters are all there in history too. Just ignore the ignorant bitches. If we gamer women want to play as female fighters, we will, on games that have them. And if a game we want to play does NOT have them, then hey, we'll play male characters and still wipe the field with the blood of our enemies.
3. 		I'll always swing towards playing female characters if I can, but damnit I love my m!Shep just as much as my femsheps.

Name: id, Length: 174, dtype: object","1. To be honest, they wouldn't be doing this if there weren't so many unbelievably thirsty guys who keep giving them money because ""boobs"".  As I've often stated on reddit, there is no community more thirsty on average than gamers.  They also tend to have extremely limited experience with women in general, let alone the good looking ones.....so they take that inexperience and their default ""white knight"" thinking and go full retard with it to the absolute delight of women.   Anyone who has played an MMO has seen just how incredibly far the rules bend when the player has a vagina versus anyone who doesn't. I don't play a lot of online games anymore but I imagine in general, it still holds true that girls don't have to play by the same rules men do.  Ah well, nothing you can do about it...you can't force a horse to drink water any more than you can force a man to confront the fact he doesn't know shit about women at all.....they have to get their on their own before they can start making progress.
2. 	My friend was given 10 gold in BC WoW to just dance as his Night Elf toon without clothing for 10 minutes. I instantly rerolled a female toon.
3. 		I rolled a female DH last expac, got m'lady'd within 10 minuets and rerolled a male. 
4. 	the weird thing is you think this only applies to gamers. the average man isn't great with attractive women, period. a handful of the most confident and/or ripped dudes, are the only ones who get enough attractive ass, that they can afford to not give a fuck about obsessing over and sucking up to hot women.
5. 		> the weird thing is you think this only applies to gamers  Show me what I wrote that demonstrates I believe it applies *only* to gamers.  I know what I wrote and I certainly know what I think.....what I don't know is how you came to that conclusion.  I only mentioned the gamer aspect because it was relevant to the topic, not because that was the only area I'm familiar with.
6. 			well you singled out gamers and claimed they are *especially* thirsty compared to the basic male population. really it's just men, men are pathetically thirsty. that's why the concept of pussy passes exist in general society at large, because all men are slaves to the pussy.  also it just plays into the ""gamer nerd"" stereotype which is pretty much from the 80s and early 90s. gaming is so common now, that the ripped as fuck dudebro at your college who smashes the kind of girls you can only jerk off to, probably plays battlefield and COD in his spare time. in fact i know several guys like that. gaming is no longer a niche hobby secluded to neckbeards and awkward virgins, it's mainstream, my man. then again, it depends on the game i guess. guys that play WoW and similar games fit the stereotype in your head, guys that play mainstream AAA games and popular online shooters are just regular ass people now.

2. 	I do not know. I only used it as a quote form the statement
3. 		I know you where. Using inappropriate language in context is appropriate. For example my use of the word faggot above. A word I don't use. I was more questioning the idiot' who wrote your post use of the word.

2. 	No one should follow any gun laws. 2A's purpose is to have sufficient weaponry to overthrow the government if it becomes tyrannical. We should have full autos along with drones, WMDs, everything.  With exceptions like Trump, the government taxes us and can't perform its most essential function which is protecting our borders, so they are stealing our money. And here we are talking about extended clips. We lost our rights a long time ago starting with the 1933 gun ban. Maybe earlier.
3. 		Considering that at the time when the Second Amendment was written, civilians had the exact same weapons as the military.   So you are 100% correct in your reasoning.
4. 			If everybody had muskets and cannons, elected officials would be forced to do their job or they'd be swiftly removed. Ocasio-Cortez, a full blown Communist was just elected a U.S. Representative. In her interview with Jake Tapper she couldn't account for $38 trillion of a $40 trillion 10 year spending plan. She wants-  - Federal housing  - 'Free' college  - Medicare for all  - Debt **forgiveness**  Why does she want all this? Because the majority of taxes throughout the entire Western world are paid by white men and she is Puerto Rican representing other Puerto Ricans. 
5. 				Question, what good is free college if you have free housing, food, medical, etc? Why bother to learn anything or better yourself when you can just fuck off and play video games all day and still have everything you'd ordinarily have to work for?
6. 					Same logic as thinking everyone will jump through all the requirements and time it takes to become a doctor while getting the same pay as a custodian. You have to be utterly retarded for it to make sense.

Name: id, Length: 76, dtype: object","1. I don't particularly like commenting on here because I'm a lurker and not a huge fan of GG, but I want to set the record straight on this.  Brad Wardell's politics have been known for a long time, and if people were review bombing him over that, the would have done the same thing to GalCiv 3, which they have not.  Stardock is in the middle of suing the original developers of Star Control to prevent them from releasing a true sequel to Star Control 2 (which any reasonable read of all the stupid contract muck surrounding this whole thing indicates that they have every right to do).  This is after saying on multiple occasions while they were developing Origins that they were ""staying out of the original Star Control universe so that hopefully Fred & Paul (the original devs) can make a true sequel some day"" or something to that effect.  A lot of us Star Control fans were really excited that Stardock was going to be making a Star Control game, and we were *doubly* excited when Fred & Paul announced they were going to make a true sequel.  At this point now (contrary to what Brad and his cronies are claiming), Fred & Paul can't realistically even *start* working on their true sequel because they've got this lawsuit hanging over their head, and the settlement offer from Stardock says outright that they're literally never allowed to make another Star Control game again as long as they live.  If Star Control: Origins is being review bombed, I can essentially guarantee you that that's the reason.  The vast majority of the fan community would like to see both Star Control games, and many of us decided not to purchase Origins *specifically because of this ridiculous lawsuit*.
2. 	Yeah, it's like he's trying to burn down the Star Control community so he can have a piece of paper saying he owns the ashes, all while claiming to be a true old-school SC fan. So strange. I can't say I have a great opinion of Brad after this.
3. 		You can't present the situation without bringing up the fact that *he actually made a Star Control game and it's good* which is something you can't say about Paul and Fred over the past quarter century. It's easy to make Stardock look like the party poopers if you leave out the little irrelevant detail that they just revived the IP. 
4. 			>he actually made a Star Control game and it's good  According to the reviews, it isn't.
5. 				According to the Steam reviews and Metacritic professional reviews, it is.    So you know, right off the bat you're being misleading.  The Metacritic user reviews are merely mediocre, and they are full of 0 point scores saying ""It is utter trash F U"" without any useful commentary.   Hence the existence of this fucking thread in the first place., because it looks like a review bomb is going on. 
6. 					And as others have pointed out ITT, there are plenty of reviews that don't appear to be ""review bombs"" pointing out that the game has flaws.  Sorry that you and Wardell both seem to think his game should be free of criticism and that anyone doing so is part of some sinister conspiracy.
7. 						>And as others have pointed out ITT, there are plenty of reviews that don't appear to be ""review bombs"" pointing out that the game has flaws.  Yes, there are, and if you leave the legitimate negative reviews in, and only peel out the obviously deceptive ""It's nothing like Star Control 0/10"" ones, you get *the same fucking mid-70's score as the game has everywhere else*, which is what I'm saying to you.  And what Brad was saying too for that matter.   >Sorry that you and Wardell both seem to think his game should be free of criticism  Sorry you can't read high school English. 
8. 							So, what you're saying is...according to the reviews, the game isn't good?  Thanks for proving my point, champ.  Got anything else you want to try?  I'll give you another shot at redeeming yourself.
9. 								No; I'm saying the things that I'm saying. Anybody else who reads this exchange will see what I mean and also see that you're being a pedantic little twat, so what's the point in me saying the same things over again when there's nobody reasonable to say them to?
10. 									What a waste of an opportunity to redeem yourself.  Not even worthy of a ""You Tried/10"".

Name: id, Length: 76, dtype: object","1. What I don't understand about this is how can certain publishers legally operate in the US when they localize explicitly loli content?  MangaGamer has released several visual novels with clearly underage characters in sexual situations (uncensored I might add) and they have no issue selling those products in the red states.  In fact, one of the few times they actually censored something was bestiality-related as that's apparently riskier to bring over, and this was in a VN that had loli incest completely intact. 
2. 	The same way people can openly sell pot in California despite it being a blatant violation of federal law: there's only so much time in the day, and so many prosecutors, so not everyone gets prosecuted.
3. 		Huh, could have swore pot wasn't illegal on a federal level anymore and it's just that most states still have it on the books.  I figured it was like fireworks, where they're illegal to own in my state, but you can just buy them in the next state over.  That being said, I think there's a difference between selling locally and adhering to those local laws and selling country-wide both digitally and physically.  And correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't places that sell pot in California smaller places and not these big conglomerates? Not that niche publishers are big conglomerates either, but they're still paying federal taxes and get more spread out coverage for their products.
4. 			> Huh, could have swore pot wasn't illegal on a federal level anymore and it's just that most states still have it on the books.   Marijuana is still regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. Chuck Schumer introduced a bill earlier this year to decriminalize it and it went nowhere.  > That being said, I think there's a difference between selling locally and adhering to those local laws and selling country-wide both digitally and physically.  Establishing personal jurisdiction has always been the big problem with obscenity cases on the Internet: some retard in Buttfuck, Iowa will always insist that some shit you posted on a server in California was clearly directed at him and therefore Iowa law should prevail.   > And correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't places that sell pot in California smaller places and not these big conglomerates?  Why would that even matter? Should the law only afford protection to 'the little guy' (i.e. people you like)? That said, it's worth noting that most of the pot shops are run by libtards who are finding that, oddly enough, most people would rather continue buying from their local dealer who doesn't seem to mind tax evasion any more than they minded selling illegal substances.

No, I was just saying in actual application of the law, a nationally-known entity with an easily looked up headquarters would be easier to go after than some small store that isn't breaking any local laws and is thus out of the jurisdiction of anyone that would care.  Though I supposed by that logic, these companies can be operating in areas where it's 100% legal and since there aren't any actual federal laws in place, anyone going after them would similarly be out of their jurisdiction, so the best they can do is go after consumers in 100% illegal areas.

I thought the logic was that it's the females body so they can dress however they want.But I guess this person disagrees 
2. 	how do men want women to look?   emaciated and a push over!   So men can play being heroes to the damsels in distress   and really that's the only role men want to play  Men don't want women who dont look emaciated and a pushover, cos those kind of women frighten men   and how can men act out their role of being heroes if women don't need heroes?  How can men call themselves manly if women are as manly as men?  Certainly men don't want to call that being feminine, not when they don't recognise that might be part of being a man?  Women can build up their strength, their weight, their muscles and flex them just as much as any man.. yikes, men say, give her a miss boys, she isn't pandering to the likes of us men?  
3. 		> Women can build up their strength, their weight, their muscles and flex them just as much as any man..   No, no they can't. Biology has determined that women just aren't as large, as strong or as quick as men are. It's a fact of nature sweetie x
4. 			you do realise that most women in stone-age times had more muscle power than the average man today?  How come one asks?   because of the work they did that built up their muscles and their diet which was totally different then.   Cupcake you wouldn't haven't been a contest to them   and you know cupcake  men have twice the upper body strength of women,!   So for women to achieve the same goals as men in labour intensive jobs women have to work twice as hard as men to realise them and women do usually achieve them.   So if women work twice as hard as men in these jobs should women be paid twice as much for the extra effort they have to put in.?  Men say if women want to be regarded to equal to men, they must act like men!  Little point in being born female then is there?   Of course if women want to build up their own body strength they should be encouraged to because they do have the muscle and when women get over male brainwashing that tells them it isn't feminine and realise it's zero to do with being manly but everything to do with being womanly they probably will  
5. 				Retard even if thats true it would just mean that stone age people were naturally stronger and the men of the time would have still been stronger then the women.  Testosterone is a hell of a drug
6. 					and that is why you are all as mad as meat axes  running around telling everyone you are godlike   when the only thing you are  is thug like, is coward like, is vain like  you are a bunch of cowards  there is nothing brave about men  men raise their fists against those who never thought to raise theirs against them  and that's what you all class as a win  the annihilation of the image of women  you men really couldn't get any further up your own arses in your insanity if you tried   Of course men are totally insane in their world order of wank  self obsessed wankers   lets have a laugh  **HE said HE really loved HER**  **when all the while it was SHE, HE really disdained.!**  men are brave like this  **“Men are superior to women because Allah gave men supremacy over women. Therefore, men receive from Allah twice as much as women. Husbands who are disobeyed by their wives can punish them, confine them to bed and even beat them. Women are the greatest calamity men received from Allah.”**  Quran, written by disciples of Mohammed, Arabia, circa 700 AD  lets disseminate it  ""we men have big fists, oh look we can beat women down with them.. ooh high5 me bro I got one cornered, who of us is going to be first in line to give her the first punch""  men are brave like that!  ----  that is how brave men really are!  ----

It’s lazy and even more insulting to their movement if you ask me.

Name: id, Length: 76, dtype: object","1. I disagree with a fundamental premise of this article. The author seems to be under the impression that because gaming journalism is inherently shallow, it attracts people who are essentially well-meaning schlubs with no talent. He doesn't stop to consider that the quality may be shit because it's filled with people who are *malicious*; people who aren't just doing this because they like talking about stuff, but people who fucking hate the thing they cover and want to destroy it.  And I'm not sure why he thinks this. Is it because gaming publications are inherently aimed at hobbyists and would thus preclude any advancement into serious fields? If so, he should stop to consider that it isn't 2005; video games are not some thing you do in a basement somewhere. They're a multi-billion dollar industry and so the defense a small hobby has against social climbers is virtually gone. And that's not mentioning how becoming popular within a niche is a well known tactic; it's how the Paul brothers got rich, and Cardi B, and virtually every ""sensation"" since Justin Bieber. Why wouldn't opportunists be lurking around? Why *wouldn't* an industry bigger than movies have people willing to tank their own reputations to destroy it?  More to the point, it *is* possible to produce quality content we could describe as ""gaming journalism"". Yeah, rehashing press releases is stupid and non-productive, but there are people who conduct interviews with developers, mess around with hardware, report on the society and culture surrounding games, (in ways that aren't just polemics against consumers) conduct serious reviews of titles, etc, etc.  So I don't think ""game journalism sucks because it's just not possible for it not to suck"" is at all a valid stance to take; it's lazy and ignores the fact that gaming publications hire people who fucking hate video games. This naive view of games journalism still being issues of *Nintendo Power* and shit like ""Ctrl+Alt+Del"" is just flat-out wrong. If this guy was a political consultant, he'd be giving advice to candidates in 2018 on how to beat Dick Nixon, appeal to the Confederate war veterans in Georgia, and stick it to the USSR.
2. 	I think there are also very specific forces at work here, forces that cannot be simply explained as the interplay between markets and supply/demand dynamics, and those forces are probably best summed up as The Leftist San Fran Tech Bubble. The percentage of ideologically retarded gamer-hating journos who live in San Fransisco (or an equivalently ridiculous city) isn't just coincidence or correlation - it's legitimately the root cause of all this progressive idiocy in journalism. Creating good videogame journalism might be as easy as figuring out how to publish it somewhere other than a Leftist urban enclave on the coast.

4. 			I’m in a Feild Botany class right now, and we’ve covered a few other members of the Salvia genus. Do you know if members like *S. greggii* or *S. coccinea* can be used as spices, or are the not as good as *S. officianlis*?

Name: id, Length: 76, dtype: object","1. I know that cheaters in online games suck, but does it alarm anyone else that a private company is able to do the below?  > The publisher of video game Grand Theft Auto V has been granted the right to search the homes of five people accused of making cheat software.  > The court order allowed Rockstar Games and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, to search two properties in Melbourne, Australia, for evidence related to a cheat known as Infamous.  > The Australian federal court has also frozen the assets of the five, who have not yet filed a defence.
2. 	Damn right it's alarming. Cheaters may be scum, but this a whole new level of bullshit.  > ""Many cheaters may believe that it's a relatively harmless activity - but they ruin the fun for legitimate players.  Yeah, sure. It's the player *experience* they're so concerned about, not the fact that it prevents them from making another billion on their shitty shark cards.  > ""Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive Software are targeting the alleged developers of these cheats, who often sell and profit from their software.""  aaaand there it is; the real reason shines through; how dare they bilk money from the ~~rubes~~ players; that's *our* job.
3. 		And let's be honest, Take Two don't give a flying fuck about Player's fun. In fact GTA Online is literally geared toward taking the fun away and pushing players into buy Shark Cards to bypass the grind. 
4. 			Gta online is getting totally insane with each update, every update they add some kind of crazy military or weaponized vehicles, stopped playing because of this, if i want to plqy military games i have those, i just want a more grounded crime game, some heists here and there and other crime related activities, but no, here have this orbital canon
5. 			I play GTAO and recently just argued this with a friend. If you have a desire to just buy shark cards, then you don't actually have a desire to play the game. Over the past few months, simply logging into the game has netted me millions of GTA bucks. They have double cash promos all the time and they have giveaways all the time that simply hand you money.  Now, if you wanted to invest time into the game and actually play it then you should have enough money by the end of doing everything to buy almost everything in the game. All the DLC is end game content. It's like buying an expansion pack with virtual currency. And once you have the CEO expansion with a garage (probably $2mil investment), you can do car heists to make money. This alone makes buying shark cards for someone who doesn't have time anymore super easy. In 15 min, you can quickly make $60,000-$80,000 and more if you collect a set of cars.  Shark cards are for two people: people who want to play that don't have time but want a fancy car to run with their friends OR people who think because a new car is out, they must buy it like some completionist autistic gamer.  All the things you buy in the game for the necessity to have fun are cheap. If you need the fancy stuff, play the game as intended or spend you money.  Back in subject though: Cheating should never get you any time in jail. And what stops in-game exploits from being considered cheating later if this doesn't get a nail in the coffin?
6. 		This happened with Sony as well in regards to PS3 hacking. When talking about all the possible things that are evil from an entertainment company (that we've seen to date anyway), this tops it.    I haven't bought a single Sony product since then and refuse to even pirate games that are only available on Sony platforms and play them on emulator. They deserve as little exposure and recognition, I'll be doing the same with Rockstar and Take-Two. 
7. 		This is a civil matter 100%. Sue them for recourse don't use  the cops and force to them get your pound of flesh.

2. 	How about this? You're an actor; not a philosopher. I don't need my trained acting monkeys to tell me how to fix the world and how evil I am. I need to them to pretend to be interesting for ninety minutes.
3. 		Would you object to an actor telling Anita Sarkesian or Hillary Clinton they're a proper cunt? What about a celebrity standing up for free speech or due process? I know I wouldn't complain. Therefore I'm not gonna be a hypocrite every time Meryl Streep wants to remind us orange man is bad. Sure I find it as annoying as you do, but no one is forcing me to follow those idiots on Twitter either.
4. 			>Would you object to an actor telling Anita Sarkesian or Hillary Clinton they're a proper cunt?  That's descriptive. What the Marvel actors are saying is prescriptive.  There's a world of difference.
5. 				And freedom of speech is freedom of speech. You want to criticize what they have to say? Chastise them for picking an inappropriate time/place? That's perfectly fine. Again, you lost me at ""shut up"".
6. 					Where did I say that? They have right to demand how we live our lives, and we have a right to call them twats for it.
7. 						So you're stroking your own dick over the distinction between descriptive/prescription just for my benefit? Thanks sweetheart.
8. 							Ah shucks, it's least I can do for someone being so wilfully obtuse! :)
9. 			I just wish these actors would express their opinions without insulting people. All these people really do is call Trump names and, on occasion, wish death on Trump supporters (Michael Shannon). Most of these actors sound incredibly hateful and angry, and I think that’s why people go “shut up and sing.”
10. 			There is a difference between the views someone shares on Twitter and those they share at Comic-Con, an event that is not their personal soapbox. I mean does guys fighting in tights have anything to do with politics? And is standing up for free speech really compare to calling Anita and Hillary that? No. That's a neutral statement, it doesn't directly insult anyone or any group.   I wouldn't praise any actor for saying something incendiary at Comic-Con. I would laugh, but I would call them an idiot for saying something like that at that event because it isn't the time nor place.
11. 				As long as they're not advocating violence/slander/libel, then I'll defend anyone's right to free speech, even if I find said speech repugnant or deem the venue inappropriate. Sure, I understand (and largely agree with) Hambly's sentiment. I just draw the line at ""shut up"". Sorry if that rustles anyone's jimmies. 
12. 	a lot of quarter pounder and suit wearing sargonites here, so yay for brigading here
13. 		...what? I don't get how you'd equate being fed up with self-aggrandising celebrities hijacking their platform to spew leftist soundbytes over the airwaves to being a Sargonite.  It's a weird reach, quite unlike how your post clearly shows you to be a faggot. 
14. 			Yeah, gotta say I'm not getting the Sargon or ""brigading"" reference here. Maybe it's the boomer in me?

Name: id, Length: 76, dtype: object","1. These shameless people are just making things worse for women. Originally when #metoo first started I tried to explain to a guy friend that these things do happen to women, but soon after I stopped defending it. It clearly became a political tool, aimed at hurting others rather than defending/helping women.  Kavanaugh case was just ridiculous. I don't understand that people were so eager to jump on him and ruin his career. They traumatized this man and his family... for what? Not is it just that I didn't see any evidence, but watching Ford and her questionable body language made me even more suspicious. Why was she trying to ""act cute""? Either Democrats took advantage of a mentally disturbed woman or this was a politically plot. In any case, it's very unfair. As women though, we do see that leftists are just using us and we are walking away.
2. 	Kavanaugh has spoken of Roe v Wade as if it is still open.  To the supreme court it can be.  Feminists think he might challenge it and they wont have their right to kill babies taken away.  In their eyes, false accusations are proper political tools.
3. 		That's a good point, I figured any conservative on Supreme Court would be against their wishes, but this makes even more sense 
4. 			Yeah.  The timing instantly made me think it was a political by nature.  I recently (trial finished in August) had my family nearly torn apart by a sexual assault case between two minors one being a close relative of my wife's and the other being a close relative of mine.  We were forced to be smack dab in the middle of the whole thing.  It was dismissed with great prejudice, but I know first hand the destructive force of these types of accusations.  My wife and I were newlywed and expecting our now 10 month old daughter when the charges were first brought up.  Even still the effects are felt.  Some aspects of my family will never, ever be the same.  I get pretty mad at blatantly false accusations.  
5. 				That's horrible, sorry to hear about that :( It's always tough when there's legal proceedings within the family. Hope things will get better!  I think a lot of female supporters of #metoo movement and feminism just follow the emotional reaction thinking those people speak for women's interests. However, intimidation and accusations are not the right way to bring change. All they do is create resistance and turn both sides against each other. Men are not going to be more respectful because they're scared, that stems from personal values. They're going to be more bitter and see women as a liability.  It's hard to discuss these topics nowadays, especially online, but I try to get people to think beyond their initial feelings.

Don't get me wrong, I voted for Macron, but he has stuff to fix before I'm happy I did it. This is not helpful.
2. 	> I voted for Macron  I wish for you to be cursed, everywhere you will go, light will cease to work and you will be left out in the dark, stumbling your pinky toes on heavy wooden furniture until your last breath.  Peut être que la prochaine fois tu te fera pas retourner la tête par la véritable propagande, les castors qui tout les cinq années font ""barrage"". 
3. 		By ""barrage"", I take it you're reffering to the second turn, where everybody voted against Le pen, rather than for Macron ?  Wrong call. I voted for the other guy because I believe her ideas are uninteresting, when his had.. very slight potential, not because of ""making a barrage"". Even if I deem the FN ideas (or should I call it the RN now ?) completely bonkers, I support their right for speech, especially as demonizing them is the best way to bring them support. Let those ideas be discussed on the marketplace of thought and voted upon.
4. 			>Wrong call. I voted for the other guy because I believe her ideas are uninteresting, when his had.. very slight potential  Like the idea of making one of the very, very few socialist system that work in a ultra capitalistic environment like his genious idea of :  - privatizing social security  - public transport  - Destroying the CDI (Contras à Durée Indéterminé) , now your will have a contract for the duration you are needed, after that you return to unemployment state, meaning you **will** lower your standards just to be able to work, good luck having a family when you don't know when and where you will work 6 months in advance.   - Being another lapdog for the Americans like Hollande/Sarkozy, Chirac told the Americans to fuck off ""looking for mass destruction weapons"" in Iraq, t'was a good thing indeed, for 8 years it was more ""Obama said : Baguette, you go there and you do this, yes sir!""   > her ideas are uninteresting  - Close the borders.  - Negociate with ""mommy"" Merkel a better deal, since we switched to € we French **lost** a fuckton of ""purchasing power"" especialy after the Greek fiasco and allowing pretty much anyone and everyone in Europe   - Revoke citizenship to people leaving the country to do the jihad in kebabistan  - Allow anything to be voted by a referendum on a national scale wise if 300,000 people sign the request.  - Revoke social aid to people being send to prison and the family of said person too if it's an aggravated crime.  - Stop the military interventionism madness (reminder that even if people like to slanders our military as surrending faggot, France have boots on ground in 17 countries up to this day, *officialy*) **or** if you wish to continue, give an appropriate budget to be able to have boots on ground in 17 countries on the nano budget we have/had (daily reminder France is the only European country that respect it's pledge to the 2.3% of GDP spend on it's Defence program in the N.A.T.O accords, when GB is at 1.8% of it's GDP and Germany at 1.2%)   I guess that uninteresting compared to a guy that clearly said he will ""ubber-ise"" the country.

I also agree that women who engage in wiling sexual behavior after drinking and regret it is very differ than predatory behavior when a woman in plied with alcohol or slipped drugs.   The thing is we, as a society need to stop viewing people as a commodity to sold, fucked, traded, used, whatever.  We are human. And until we can see that in each other the worst of humanity will probably win out 
3. 		“Historically” , meaning it used to be a thing. And not just some time ago, a LONG time ago. That kind of thing happened everywhere. It’s not specific to Britain. Yes it’s bad. Yes we all know it happened. Saying that “it’s worse today than it ever was” and there is a “rape culture” is just straight out factually incorrect and dumb 
4. 			And historically I mean it happened up until about the 1960s.  Certainly hundreds of years before that but let’s not pretend that unwed mothers homes and social pariahs based on premarital sex was a thing of the dark ages.  Women’s didn’t really gain their sexual freedom until the BCP. Then they could say I’ll sleep with you, but I’m not going to marry you and I’m not going to have your kid. Sexual revolution. 
5. 			What people mean by “rape culture” is that societally we set up barriers for victims of rape (both sexes) to prevent them from reporting it. Or we treat it as a non-crime. When I’m sitting at my job completing my state mandated safety training (everything from using a vpn to secured areas) and one of the topics is legitimately about protecting myself from rapists by watching my alcohol consumption that is rape culture.  My job has nothing to do with alcohol consumption or sexual violence. It’s a little tsk tsk to me about my behavior that is none of my employers business and how they believe I should act.  Second, I don’t recall any other tips being given out like don’t go walking alone in the middle of the night in the crappy part of town if you don’t want to get murdered. The point is that when it comes to rape, time and time again the onus is put on the victim to avoid rape and not on the perpetrator to not commit rape or to face the consequences for committing rape. A robbery doesn’t happen if a robber isn’t present and willingly committing a crime. A murder isn’t happening if a murderer isn’t present and committing a crime. A rape is t happening unless a rapist is present a committing a crime.  We think of things like country music as being fairly sweet, innocent, and encompassing American values.  My husband likes this song called Everclear and I fucking hate it. In the song the man sings gleefully about being In love with a particular girl so he slips Everclear in her drink to make her easy.  But she passed out so he just left her laying on her front lawn.  Everything about that screams rape.  He did not have consent in anyway. Singing about and making money off it and saying it’s just a song...that’s rape culture.  It values those things over what real human beings experience every single day.   Those are just anecdotes but if you’re going to say there isn’t a rape culture show me how that is possible when we live in a world where we treat each other as commodities. 
6. 				Maybe in that rape is actually illegal? A chargeable offence with a hefty amount of jail time but no, it's COMPLETELY socially acceptable you say.  Your also completely ignoring that rapists don't care if rape is illegal or not, fucking hell everyone knows it's wrong if they haven't been living underneath a rock for the last 20 years.  This is paramount to someone trying to rape you and you telling them mid act it's against the law. You can't control the aggressor in this scenario, you can only help the potential victims take counter measures, like not drinking alcohol, fucking hell your companies trying to help you avoid it.  It continues to baffle me that people say we live in a rape culture, when the west can almost be considered to be the anti-thesis of it, men's lives thrown away over a baseless accusation. 
7. 				Ok? And Carrie Underwood and Kelly Clarkson both got famous with songs about trashing their ex bf’s belongings because they’re mad.  If we’re basing off of pop songs you’re in for a bad time. 
8. 				RAIIN disagree.
9. 				Wow you are off the deep end

Name: id, Length: 76, dtype: object","1. Mother is a fat ugly used up trash cunt and the daughter will take after her.  The daughter already has the entitled attitude and is a disgusting person.  They didn't learn anything, and the next dude who has to deal with these two cunts will probably have the same ordeal.
2. 	Will probably be worse. This is guy is LUCKY he was filming. The daughter seems just like the type to attack him, get beaten in self-defense, then cry ""assault"" when the cops show up.  This is the type of shit that makes me want put cameras inside my car. Not because everyday driving is dangerous, but for that one time it's gonna be my word vs theirs and the cops think I am too male and too black to be believed.
3. 		Hey man you should have a dash cam anyway. Any accidents you have, the claim will be a lot easier with video proof. Just get one! Could save ya.
4. 			Dash cams are too cheap to not have one! I have one in each of my cars, one has two cameras, one for the front and one for the rear. Less than $130, cheaper than a lawyer for 5 minutes 
5. 				It took me awhile to convince my wife we should get one, and I still haven't had the ""Gotcha you son of a bitch"" moment I was wanting so everytime we get in the car I hear a snide ""waste of money"" remark. But when it happens... oh the sweet sweet feeling of justice.
6. 					This perfectly describes the foundation of my marriage.  
7. 					LOL..  I feel ya brother!  
8. 					1. I've had SD card that got corrupted. Luckily, there was notification on camera screen that it can't record. Solved by replacing SD card. 2. My dash cam was 5yo and internal battery didn't hold the charge as it supposed to. So when I've got into accident car shut off and video file became corrupted. I couldn't recover incident video.  Since then I bought a new camera, wired it directly to battery so that it works all the time, not only when ignition is on.
9. 			I have one, about to put a second on the back windshield. I just recorded a guy run a red light today almost clipping two vehicles. And then yesterday some guy made a left forcing me to slam my breaks. 
10. 		Speaking as a white guy, if I was black I'd keep a body cam on me at all times.  Getting up to go pee in the middle of the night, better strap on the camera.  Can't be too careful.
11. 		That last part is too real. There's been multiple times where cops have stopped me and one of my roommates because ""they fit the description"" and didn't believe a word of their alibi until I confirmed it. And they don't even ask questions when I confirm it. Like fuck, if the description is ""tall African American male"" why are you stopping a guy who is shorter than me? I'm 5'8"". And why the fuck do you not believe a word he says and then don't even ask questions once I get involved?
12. 			Most people that get arrested for petty crimes spend months in jail and have their lives ruined, or plead guilty to bullshit crimes and trumped up charges to avoid a long prison sentence
13. 			With 29,000,000,000+ unsolved crimes in the US, every single person, including every newborn and old lady in a nursing home, ''fits the description'' at this point. 
14. 				I think you've missed the point
15. 					That is one of the lamest reddit comment cliches ever devised. But you do you. 
16. 		\+1 for dashcam
17. 	The dismissive attitude they gave the cop as soon as they realised he wasn't going to help them said it all really    
18. 		Of course, if a man refuses to be a White Knight then he is of no use to a modern trash female. He is worse than shit in their eyes.
19. 	I could probably fuck the daughter as long as she's got change for a five. I can use that three bucks for some beer goggles.
20. 	if only men had standards so these cunts would be incels

2. 	Well there's your stupid contribution to nothing. ""Duh he stupid."" you five years old? Tyke. 
3. 		He’s full of it. He “didn’t sleep for 30 days”. He wanted Kavanaugh to step down for being seen as “divisive”. He claims to have re-written every sentence is his first look like 8 times; bullshit. He thinks asking someone if they believe in Christ’s resurrection is more offensive them asking them about what they “do in bed”. His meat-only diet, while technically fine, is extreme and oddly symbolic. And he’s clearly an angry dude — conspicuously intense even in chill settings. I used to love the guy. I have his book. I’ve gone to see him speak. He’s a bad character, who says some otherwise good stuff. But he is bad news.
4. 			Oddly enough I haven't seen you break into tears recanting the reasons strangers come up to you on the street to shake your hand and remark about how you've changed their lives.     The guy has a heart of gold and has studied the worst in humankind. If you think HE is bad news; I guess that makes you.....  ??
5. 				You’ll figure it out, eventually. He is disingenuous. 
6. 					Damn. I'll eventually figure it out?  What Will I do until then?  Please, tell me the people I can look up to and follow blindly....  Is Scheer a good guy?  I heard Trudeau is OK. ... it's too bad it was #HerTurn

8. 							Okay, Kathy Newman   So What you're REALLY saying is...  I'm going to be DEVASTATED when I discover JBP isn't Christ reincarnated. You mean... He's just a human? A White Male even? ... You're saying...  He Might get something wrong and because of that he can't be trusted - in fact he should be killed. Because the CBC told me he is a racist nazi bigot jew lover who wouldn't let the transpipo in his class even LIVE or EXIST...  *face palm*  Thanks for saving me
9. 							2 reasons is easy:  1) He calls out post moderism and cultural Marxism as bullshit and something dangerous  2) He speaks up about personal responsibility and individualism  How's he going to betray that.  He's been teaching this for over 20 years.  You're an ignorant fool, or a troll.  Either way here's my advice :  Go clean your room 
10. 					So he's bad because he's hyperbolic and neurotic? I don't follow him very closely, but appreciated his talks on communism and biology. The fact that he isn't fringe is probably positive, since he can repackage some of the more controversial ideas for a laymen audience. For example, he's done IQ and dipped his toes into race. What have you got on him?  FYI, not a downvoting leddit mobber either.

She also denied saying she fainted at the scene and an ambulance was called.  >The woman further contended that police had no basis to make comments about her **possible mental health issues**.  It's 10 AM, already seen the fucking joke of the day hahahaha. 
2. 	I'd say her trying to sue over a handshake is evidence enough of her ""*mental health issues*"".
3. 		She would not be suing him. In Australia, you get money, and some other benefits  (free counciling and healthcare) from the government if you are a victim of violent crime. In some cases it can be a substantial amount of money depending on how bad the assult is.   So she is upset that the government wont see her as a victim of violent crime. The people that work with this are working with people who are beaten, raped, and stabbed, or families of murder victims.  I think it is a bit of an insult to them to have to take her seriously. 
4. 			Interesting system, what are your thoughts on it.  Does it work? Or is it, how I imagine it, rife with bogus claims?  Im from Canada which has pretty much the same old system like the US, and things can take a decade to go through the courts until a verdict is finally met.  Are things done quicker down in OZ?  Id love to see your country one day,  but the huge spiders and insane heat will keep me away for the time being.  I was in South Korea in August for 3 weeks and just about died from the heat so I imagine OZ would be even worse.  Cheers mate.

Name: id, Length: 76, dtype: object","1. The amusing thing is that they put her in as a ""Fuck men!"" move, yet men are more likely to play as her due to sex appeal. 
2. 	I don't think men are more likely to play a female character, much less due to ""sex appeal.""  Games aren't about sex. It's basically the opposite, the more you game the less you will have sex.  Female action movies/games are by definition *camp.*  Having a male character in an action/fighting game is far more immersive.
3. 		The whole ""gamers don't have sex"" thing was a worn out stereotype 20 years ago. Even if it were true not having sex wouldn't mean that you are uninterested in sex so sex appeal would still be a thing that could influence your preferences.  &#x200B;  Action movies in general are pretty fucking camp to varying degrees. One badass goes around being some immortal god of destruction. Is Bayonetta campier than Devil May Cry though? Would Kill Bill have been less campy with a male lead? Was Aliens more campy than Commando? I think there are times an action movie putting a woman in a particular role doing some things can make it campier but just being like ""oh women action movies are so much campier than men action movies"" is retarded.
4. 			> Bayonetta campier than Devil May Cry  They're both very camp.    > Would Kill Bill have been less campy with a male lead?  Slightly.  Camp isn't really a problem either.  I like Bloodborne, which I put in the camp category.  I still play as a man, but a woman fits that setting equally well.  >""oh women action movies are so much campier than men action movies"" is retarded.  Yeah, no it's not.  It's always going to be an extra layer of camp.  No one said that games with male leads can't be camp, but a female action hero is ALWAYS camp. Sorry, buddy.

I think it's a long time coming and I'm sorry for pointless drama, which is rather hypocritical of me considering I'm always telling people I hate drama.  Go figure.   Toohhnnee I'm sorry man.

Watergate had a break-in. ‘Gamergate’ at least had the (thoroughly discredited) idea that there was something fishy around ‘ethics in game journalism.’ ‘Comicsgate’ has nothing — no scandal, no event, nothing to prove and nothing to deny — beyond ‘I don’t like some comics and would like for them not to exist.'”  Lol - this guy has no idea what he's talking about re: GG.  At least Liana tries to be somewhat sensible in this, even in a 'this whole thing is a dumb internet slapfight' sense.  Edit:  IDK if this shit counts as a 'scandal', but there's certainly been some fuckery from comics pros and related internet entities (if OAG is borked again look them up on archive).  https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2018/01/sjw-writers-attempt-get-ethan-van-sciver-fired-dc-comics/50310/  https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2017/11/marvel-comics-editor-allegedly-colludes-sjws-take-diversity-comics-patreon/44463/  https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2017/12/polygon-writer-kieran-shiach-rallies-sjws-take-diversity-comics-patreon/47730/  https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2018/01/industry-pros-try-get-jon-malin-fired-marvel-tweeting-sjws/49803/  https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/09/21/secret-facebook-page-reveals-marvel-dc-comics-writers-conspiring-harass-comic-con-conservatives/  https://nickmonroe.blog/2018/02/12/on-ethan-van-sciver-and-comicsgate/  http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/16/dc-comics-artist-gets-accused-of-being-a-nazi-because-hes-a-republican/  http://dailycaller.com/2018/01/30/ethan-van-sciver-violence/  http://boundingintocomics.com/2018/02/23/comic-book-writer-wishes-horrible-death-afghanistan-veteran/  http://boundingintocomics.com/2018/02/01/cbr-polygon-writer-kieran-shiach-campaigns-dc-comics-fire-artist-ethan-van-sciver/  http://boundingintocomics.com/2018/01/29/dc-comics-artists-ethan-van-sciver-faces-new-threat-of-violence/  https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2018/03/twitter-suspends-image-comics-writer-following-defamatory-harassment-critic/54809/  http://boundingintocomics.com/2018/03/29/image-comics-appears-to-make-official-statement-regarding-michelle-perez/  https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/7ip7ua/drama_so_it_seems_diversity_comics_has_a_stalker/  https://imgur.com/a/4HCCz
2. 	\>(thouroughly discredited)  *NOTORIOUS MASS MURDERER SIRIUS BLACK*
3. 		That's why you can't trust ~~mainstream media~~ The Daily Prophet to tell the truth and have to turn to the conspiracy theorist ~~Alex Jones~~ Xenophillius Lovegood to get the real truth. In the mean time, don't forget to bring your ~~assault rifle~~ wand that everyone carries in school to the ~~anti-government militia shooting range~~ Dumbledore's Army training session. We need to be able to fight back against the ~~feminist~~ crazy cat lady that has turned the education system into an authoritarian indoctrination center.   I don't understand their obsession with Harry Potter.   edit: mixed up Rita Skeeter with Xenophillius Lovegood
4. 			Rita Skeeter is the very definition of hack writing and unethical journalism. You're thinking about Xenophilius Lovegood and his tabloid The Quibbler, which is the only publication willing to publish Harry's side when the government is in denial of Voldemort's return.
5. 				You are right. Rita Skeeter is A.J. Daulerio. Fixed.
6. 			>I don't understand their obsession with Harry Potter.  Harry Potter books were intended for children/teens. These people are emotionally/mentally children.  I'm not discrediting the book series, mind you. If you like them, that's cool. I'm just saying this why SJWs are obsessed with them.
7. 				From what I’ve seen it’s the female nerd equivalent of nerdy guys liking Star Wars.  It’s ubiquitous to the point it’s almost a cliche for someone to say either is their favourite movie/book series (And more specifically to say The Empire Strikes Back or Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one in the series).
8. 	Also, if there is nothing, no scandal or anything, why every single wannabe and has been comic creator tweets daily about comicsgate? (and people asks why these people keeps missing deadlines. If you spend all your day and night tweeting retarded bullshit, thank fuck you don't have time to write/draw your stuff)

Name: id, dtype: object","1. I wonder why the victim was granted custody of the children. /s
2. 	My mother in law worked at The Foundling Hospital here in NYC and she saw a child whose mother admitted that she intentionally sat him in acid as a baby (resulting in the child having his genitals destroyed and being in agonizing pain every time he had to use the bathroom for the rest of his life) be EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO THE MOTHER.  So you know she’s a complete waste of life when a woman loses custody. You pretty much have to get caught red-handed simultaneously filming and distributing child porn of your child while also doing heroin while also beating them with an object (just a hand won’t be enough) while also raping a police officer. And even then they will just send a CPS agent to ask questions. So for a woman to actually lose custody to the father, you know she’s about the worst person on the planet. 
3. 		This makes me fucking sick and so pissed off.  Our 3mo old died from SIDS. We had cannabis in the home at the time of his death. They searched our house for close to, if not over, ten hours. They took my grandmothers ashes that were in a pill bottle (whole other story - aunt is a pillhead) because they thought it was coke?? Bone fragments visible in it and everything. Then the 10month CPS case ensued. They took our oldest and placed him with my parents for 2 weeks until we tested clean. They tested our son twice for cannabis because he was exclusively breastfed, we didn't get his ashes back for about 2months after his death. They tried to put my husband and I in drug court. They denied us. Wanted us to go to a drug rehab center twice a week. Classes were separated by gender. This meant we would have had to go 4 times a week on top of my husband working full time, at the time. We're 30 minutes away from any towns. We demanded someone come to our house if they wanted us to do all that crap. So then we went through about 6 different counselors who came to our house every single week. He passed February 2015 and our case was not closed until December 2015. All because of cannabis. Such bullshit. 
4. 			Yep. Cannabis is the middle of nowhere (and even city) police departments’ bread and butter. Under current federal legislation it is permissible for departments to seize assets whenever they have “reasonable suspicion” that the suspect has been distributing “narcotics”. They DO NOT HAVE TO PROVE THIS IN COURT. THE SUSPECT CAN BE CLEARED OF ALL CHARGES AND THEY CAN KEEP THEIR SEIZED MONEY AND PROPERTY. Up to 90% of assets seized can be kept by the seizing local authorities, with the remainder being handed up the food chain to the feds.     The reason given is that it strangles cartels by cutting off their resources. Can they explain seizing a couple’s home because their son was accused of selling small quantities of drugs? Pretty sure these otherwise unblemished citizens are not secretly El Chapo. SERIOUSLY GOOGLE IT.     Here’s where marijuana comes in. Because of the PROVEN fact that marijuana does not have physically addictive properties, causes no craving or withdrawal beyond that which would be experienced by someone if you took their television away, it is a substance that you have a decent chance of finding at any given stop and search. Every kind of person in this country smokes weed. The CEOs, the preachers, the moms, the saints, the sinners. It has zero impact on a normal healthy person’s ability to function and live a normal, successful life. Its “addictive” properties are like those of sex or food, it’s only addictive to someone who has problems with emotions, self control, and/or discipline. Most humans can pick it up and put it down as they please, and those who can’t would have found something to have a problem with anyway. Leaving marijuana as a schedule 1 narcotic and continuing the charade of pretending to believe that it “kills kids” is what keeps local law enforcement in business in Bumblescum, NowhereState. Unlike the NYPD where they have plenty of tax dollars rolling in per capita and they just use marijuana statutes to intimidate and harass an overwhelmingly poor and marginalized sector of the city, there is not enough actual crime to sustain their justifications for keeping a force at all, let alone a force as large as they do have, and there is no money in taking down actual criminals (like rapists). So what is a corrupt police/sheriff’s department to do?    You are a victim of the continuing playacting where law enforcement and other institutions pretend that they genuinely believe that marijuana is “a dangerous drug”.    Everyone I have spoken to in healthcare understands that the health risks come from smoking via combustion methods and have the same risks as smoking cigarettes, except without a proven addictive substance involved that causes clinically documented physical craving and withdrawal. Additionally, the several contacts I have in law enforcement are extremely aware that marijuana is a relatively benign substance that is used as a tool against poor and dark people.    Read the description of the first hearing to make marijuana illegal. They have a direct quote of an argument used to justify the legislation that I will paraphrase here: “.. you give a Mexican in the field a puff of a marijuana cigarette and he thinks he’s a bullfighter in Toledo”. More racism and classism. On the federal level, they claimed to have “isolated the active ingredient “ and injected it into dogs’ brains, a couple of which died. THC was not isolated and identified until WWII or possibly just after. This “study” was “performed” many years before this discovery.        An educated population is the only cure, but I doubt it will happen in my lifetime.

It's possible she was being encouraged to do these things for followers and views online and the guys were probs making a shit ton of money off her. It seems odd she would agree to do this knowing she would fail.
2. 	> It's possible she was being encouraged to do these things for followers and views online and the guys were probs making a shit ton of money off her.  Why can't people just call her a cunt? She's a grown woman, stop treating women like delicate flowers. 
3. 		People probably don't want to call her a cunt because of the fact she may be being abused/manipulated by someone. Also we shouldn't be going around calling people cunts for no reason you cunt.
4. 			> fact she may be being abused/manipulated by someone  You're only assuming that because she's a woman right?   She's obviously a cunt, did you not see the whole video? Lying and scamming her followers and the community for ad $$ is cuntish behaviour 
5. 				I'm assuming that because of the way the guys trying to control everyone in the video and how he's treating her.

2. 	100/100, should've been the main protagonist - pc gamer, probably
3. 		According to the Lore she's actually the ""Canon"" main character. They just didn't use her for marketing because they thought it would cause a Battlefield 5 situation. Whether you think that's true or not is up to you.  So the article should've been  >0/100, character is attractive and doesn't look like a retarded bridge troll (their writing staff who think they're normal/average when they're really not)
4. 			Assassin's Creed is complete fiction. Nobody would be surprised at a Spartan Warrior Princess or hell even a fucking AMAZON, a literal mythological warrior woman with one breast missing for historical accuracy and to better shoot a bow.  Now depicting the Russo-Japanese war with armies on both sides with women in it... you are stepping on some serious toes now. Historical toes. Very sensitive toes that have been hit with many hammers like black Legionaries and black British Queens.  &#x200B;
5. 		If Kassandra is indeed a female and has a vagina(I didn’t play the game so I don’t know) you can forget about it. They’re just a bunch of faggots, now. They wouldn’t recognize a vagina even if a woman spreads herself live in front of them. Even the gays must think they’re retarded. How low did they drop.

3. 		And further, assume that the full on rednecks are all idiots.  Sometimes those ""rednecks"" are incredibly intelligent, just... not book smart.  And sometimes, they're book smart.  Turns out dumb and smart people live everywhere, with different opinions and values

3. 		All jokes aside, it does seem that the women with the biggest self-esteem issues are the ones that complain the most about sexualising women.      Think about it, women are competitive. If you're below average attractiveness then of course you are going to want to surround yourself with people that are against even acknowledging that humans are attracted to one another.

Name: id, dtype: object","1. >Holly Davis, 34, was initially charged with first-degree murder for killing Yue Jiang after hitting her car in suburban Phoenix in 2016 but pleaded guilty to second-degree murder under a deal with prosecutors.   WTF!!!!  >Davis also cried and sought forgiveness from Jiang's family.  >""No words can express how sorry I am,"" Davis said. ""If I could bring her back, I would. If I could take her place, I would.""  Playing the victim. What a surprise.  >Her attorney said Davis had experienced a lifetime of tragedy and abuse and had been homeless and addicted to drugs.  Excuses excuses.  >Davis rear-ended a car Jiang, a college sophomore, was driving. **A passenger in Jiang's car got out to inspect the damage when he saw Davis point a gun at him. Davis then walked up to Jiang and shot her several times, authorities said.**  What the fuck.  Why would you pull a gun.  Then she killed in cold blood the driver.  How is this not premeditated.  How the fuck did she only get 25 years.   >Davis fled but was later caught.  Why was she not also charged with fleeing the scene of an accident.  >Jiang's family said the plea deal placed more value on Davis' life than on Jiang's  Exactly.  >urged the judge to reject it. But he accepted it this week.  This ""judge"" needs to be disbarred.  >""I don't find you a monster, but what you did was monstrous. It was senseless, and it was cruel,""  If the judge does not find her as a monster even though what she did was monstrous does that mean the judge likes what she did.
2. 	Over a fucking dumb car.  A car, who gives a shit.  This bitch should be given the death penalty, she has no place in any kind of existence.   Just erased her from her family and friends for a car accident.  Fucking cunt.  I hold out hope she has a brain tumor, how could anyone do something like this.  I guess I am delusional, people die for 10 dollars or less plenty in the hood.

Name: id, dtype: object","1. >""Entitled Gamers""  &#x200B;  That's a weird phrase to have come up in this whole thing. I mean, I think the entire thing from every side stinks of being a PR stunt to raise the profile of an aging game that didn't perform to expectations and damaged the reputation of the franchise and developer.  But I mean, if you've purchased and used a product, you are actually entitled to review that product and give your opinion, even if you're a dipshit, even if your opinion sucks and even if the basis for your opinion is wrong. You're especially entitled to that if the product is being changed well after you've already paid for it.  &#x200B;
2. 	Imagine if you changed it from ""Entitled Gamers"" to the more accurate ""Entitled Customers"".    See how retarded ""Entitled Customers"" sounds?

2. 	Don't worry, she doesn't look cool. She just looks like that half-shaven hair, edgy character trope, which is the big uncool; totally bogus. You browse r/tumblrinaction, which is cool.
3. 		The last time I saw Roger was last year at the Boxing Day Test. He’d turned into such a fat, normal yobbo cunt.  ""The wife nearly didn’t let me out today,"" he said.  And he did all that chanting yobs do, like; ""Ooh, ahh, Glenn McGrath"".  It got you in the end, I thought to myself as I looked at Roger. Life got you in the end, pal. You were such a cocky successful winner when we were sixteen, But now you’re just another sad, fat prick sitting in the MCG high-fiving in self-congratulation, as if it’s *you* that had the skill and determination to play for Australia.  It’s the cunts with the bad haircuts that you’ve got to watch out for. There’s never been a popular teenager yet who’s done rats with their life. It’s the fucking dorks that give it a real go.  Glenn McGrath got 5 for 50 that day.
4. 			""I've never been a fan of Internet Explorer""  Crowd laughs nervously and a few grunts are heard from the back seats as people edge closer to hear the punchline.  ""Why not? Don't you like the internet?""  The crowd suddenly stands up, aware that they are about to receive what they came for. People slowly edge closer to the set as Sheldon prepares for his next line. Sweat is clearly visible on his brow and his mouth is quivering in anticipation as he readies himself for what is about to happen.  ""I just prefer Firefox because, like the fox, I am cunning and nimble.""  The crowd suddenly surges forward as the words escape Sheldon's mouth. They are so powerful, they almost shake the very foundations of the CBS studios. He watches as, in what he perceives as slow motion, the crowd moves toward his fragile body. He has been preparing for this moment his whole life. This is his moment. This is his Emmy. This is his Golden Globe. This is even his Oscar. The crowd converges around him so quickly they ignore the trampled cries of Leonard and Penny, who now lie shaking on the floor, their bones crushed by the sheer mass of the crowd. Sheldon stares back at the eyes around him. What he sees are no longer people. What he sees is the human psyche stripped down to its core. Their lives, what they were before this moment has been forgotten. Ravenous. Hungry. They want one thing from him. Sheldon closes his eyes, clears his mind and relaxes his body. What happens next depends completely on the next few seconds. The time between this and what he mutters next feels like an eternity. Slowly, he opens his eyes. He looks at Leonard, then at Penny, both lying lifeless on the floor. Without a second thought, he says with resounding conviction...  ""BAZINGA""  In a split second, the crowd pounces on his ready and waiting body. Man, woman, child all at once. Sheldon cries out in complete ecstasy as they consume his flesh. He stops suddenly, as he drifts into eternal slumber. Peace at last.

Name: id, dtype: object","1. Of course the ""outrage"" is from prosecutors and journalists: people who likely know nothing about video games, and do not recognize their value as a medium of entertainment and art. Lol, I guessed IPN (the Institue of National Remembrance) was going to be mentioned, because it's just the kind of thing they'd take umbrage over.   I'm Polish and I don't feel insulted. Now, the phrase ""Polish death camps"" does tick me off, but almost no one who says it means it in the way that they were Polish-run, and if they do, they're usually just misinformed.   However, what would really piss me off is if the game is banned or in any way censored. We don't lynch Hollywood actors for portraying Nazis, but pixels representing fictional Nazis are too much? I heard no outrage about Wolfenstein 2014, WHICH FEATURED A WHOLE GAMEPLAY SECTION IN A NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP.   This is dumb and embarrassing for people who are trying to make this a thing, and for Poland as a whole by proxy. Every fucking time this comes up some cunt runs to file a complaint with the prosecution and another cunt in the govt demands an apology from Germany, when *Germans are the last people who would make that mistake with the phrasing*. The subject is not taboo just because sometimes people don't already know the history and need to be corrected.  It's just exhausting.
2. 	> Lol, I guessed IPN (the Institue of National Remembrance) was going to be mentioned  From what I understood from their message on IPN's page, they actually went after that cunt that modified the trailer (and has two more cunty videos on his channel), not after the actual game itself.  The journalists however - especially the rightwing ones - seen IPN's message and went after everything. No surprise there, lol.  >  Germans are the last people who would make that mistake with the phrasing.  You would think so. Sadly, you would be wrong.  - http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,6928930,_Polish_Camps__in_Polish_Court.html - https://fakty.interia.pl/news-byly-wiezien-auschwitz-skarzy-zdf-za-polskie-obozy,nId,999725

Name: id, dtype: object","1. The rule of the thumb is, if you want to find something out, ignore the journo, and read the survey. People not liking ""political correctness"", doesn't mean their views are otherwise encouraging, and while they dislike it in similar proportions, it's far from clear that what they mean by this term is at all similar.
2. 	My rule of thumb is, if the alt-left hates it, I’m gonna love it and I buy that thing. 9/10 I do enjoy it and doing it out of spite of them makes it 11/10, would bang again for me
3. 		So you buy things out of spite and hate? I mean no offense but this seems like pretty extremist behavior. ""What, these people hate the Klu Klux Klan merch that they're selling for fundraising a racist organisation? ILL JUST BUY SOME TO OWN THE LIBTARDS LE EPIC STYLE""
4. 			I think his point was that if the usual suspects are clutching their pearls and calling something problematic, there's a decent chance it's worth looking into.     For instance, when the whole comicsgate thing kicked off and our boi Zach kickstarted his book, I ordered a copy. I've never been particularly into comics, but I like the goofy motherfucker and I had the cash laying around so why not?     If a creator has the balls to stand up for their vision and tell all of the current-year moral inquisitors to get fucked, there's a pretty decent chance I'll be willing to fork over some cash and support their product. 
5. 				Now we have to worry that IndieGoGo will arbitrarily decide they don't like him and cancel the campaign right before completion like they did with Chuck Dixon.
6. 					I'm getting sick and fucking tired of middleman faggots dictating what I can and can't buy, what media I can consume, what opinions I can express, and every other fucking facet of my internet life. They're like a more-insufferable version of those Amazonian dick minnows that swim up your peckerhole and shoot barbs into your urethra. And as if that weren't bad enough the parasitic little cock-burrowers have the audacity to demand that they be able to peruse a menu and pick which dickhole they prefer to infest.    It's fucking ridiculous. I pay money to a content creator to fund his work, and the site leeches their cut off the top. That's how the game works, and I'm cool with that. Gotta pay if you want to play. But something's clearly and inherently broken when these modern day pharisees cut into their own profits to prevent a perfectly legal transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller.       These are the types of things that drive men to take drastic measures. There's a miasmatic aura of frustration and anger lurking just below the surface of polite day-to-day discourse in this country. (U.S. I won't speak for the rest of the west, though I suspect this is true elsewhere) The fact that the myriad bad actors on the left seem dead set on hacking through the last handful of threads holding our collective decency together is honestly highly concerning to me. I feel like we're a handful of bad actions away from crossing the line onto a one way street not one of us is going to enjoy very much.    Sorry about the wall of text. Sometimes I get on a roll and lose sense of when to shut the fuck up.

Name: id, dtype: object","1. Good. Sucks for the woman that he had affairs, but that's what the divorce is for. She got almost $10million and hundreds of thousands more every year, and that isn't enough? Someone this entitled deserves to lose all of it and earn their keep.
2. 	Yeah they both are awful people
3. 		I don't know if an affair necessarily makes someone an awful person, but if he was unhappy with her he should have left her before cheating.
4. 			I say it does why hurt someone like that, just break up and move on.
5. 				Because if he initiated divorce he was likely to lose much more than he did.
6. 					So instead just cheat on her? That’s so selfish.  Does marriage mean nothing
7. 						Rather then get cleaned out financially for life, who would volunteer for that? I'm in the boat of never getting married anyway. 
8. 							Right. Then don’t get married. But if you get married and make the vow, be a man and follow through with your vows
9. 								By that line of reasoning the wife agreed to giving a lifetime of blowjobs, yes?  Of course she doesn't owe him blowjobs. The very idea is absurd.   And, by the same token, he doesn't owe her a single fucking dime of his money.  > be a man and follow through with your vows  One of those vows is ""for richer and for poorer""  A ""Strong Independent Womyn"" can pay her own goddamned bills.
10. 									A lot of this thread seems to be outright woman hating.  The point of the argument is that he should not cheat because he made a vow and she is crazy for trying to steal all his money.  Both are in the wrong
11. 										I find it somewhat amusing that asking women to to pay their own way is seen by you as ""outright woman hating"".  Cheating is a despicable thing to do, I agree with you on that.   But a woman who cheats on a man doesn't owe him money. Can we at least agree on that?
12. 											Of course we agree on that.  Of course! But where did we get that she cheated.  We know for a fact he cheated.  That’s all I’m saying.   I think we are both saying the same thing

Name: id, dtype: object","1. The movie barely made 8% on Kickstarter. Talk about free publicity.  *****  The source of the black humour is the Party leadership throwing, well, a lavish party, while a city of several millions starves at exactly 125 g of black bread per day per civilian. This obviously goes against Soviet historiography, which is accepted as standard that is best not deviated from in Russian political discourse - even though it’s fairly widely known that the leadership in Leningrad did enjoy less-than-entirely-pressing conditions.  It also hits the Russian political elite as close to home as the NPC meme.  *****  Oh, Marx, someone has tried to up the retardation ante already, and played the “obscure politically incorrect incident from the past” card. Poorly.  https://www.rt.com/russia/441886-rogozin-nazi-fake-photo/  Huge country, huge morons.

Name: id, dtype: object","1. People whine this sub doesnt support liberals or hates them. This isn't true.   Here's the thing. And reminder, jokes require truth as an element to be funny.  The left can't meme. Why would shitty memes get up voted in general? They don't. They left can't meme. One in five hundred sure. So left wing memes don't go anywhere because they suck.  The left can't argue anything past surface level bs. Many of them have the depth of a puddle, mentally, and can argue one position. The one you read everywhere. The one jerked off in every leftist subreddit. It's never taken beyond that. Ever. It's just jerked off.   People whine fox news is bias. Fox news started as a Christian conservative network to combat leftist perceived slant, so, suggesting they are bias when they literally started to combat liberal news is beyond retarded. It's tiring listening to leftist media whine about trump all day and not report actual news while saying they are neutral and its frustrating talking to people who can't see the difference. It's boring talking to people that do the same. You don't learn anything you just keeping staring at the same wall, never walking through any doors. Talking to a leftist is watching paint dry.   Everything's a cheer leading slogan. Their views fit into the character limit of a twitter comment. What they promote and what they do are 100% the opposite. The left act like women. It's tough being around a guy who acts like a woman. It's tough talking to loony leftist women.  Its not that the left isn't tolerated here, it's that they are often horrible stereotypes with nothing interesting to say that offers critical thought, funny thought, etc. Nothing that's worth up voting, nothing that orzbluefog thinks is amazing.   A leftist laying out a step by step plan of how anything they offer actually works, that would be a good thing to add. Yet, nothing. Go look at a libertarian party and you'll see a real breakdown of how something needs to be done. Look at leftist, it's just ""get government to do it"" or ""raise taxes, create a tax.""  So firstly why did you read this (I'm killing time in a hotel) and secondly I want to hear a leftist actually lay out a plan and be the first leftist to actually do it.  ****Tldr**** fuck all anything worth reading. 
2. 	> the left can’t meme  That the right wants to replace actual discourse with memes is exactly the stereotype the left has of the right.
3. 	Amen.  Well spoken.
4. 	[deleted]
5. 		I think we can all acknowledge that some of our meme economy comes from the refugee liberals that were escaping persecution.
6. 			> the refugee liberals that were escaping persecution.  ...wait, I'm a refugee?  Can I get some money then?
7. 		I’m partial to tankie memes personally. 
8. 	This reminds me of Dr. JP's BTFO against the British GQ interviewer. He said something like, ""I probably could predict what you're going to say next [about politics] and that's not good. I could replace you with anyone else from the ideological left and we'd have the same conversation"". Something like that. So many people can't give a real 'why' as to their beliefs. I totally agree with you because I see so many following and don't think about the consequences.
9. 		He called that interviewer an NPC with a really fancy explanation.
10. 	> People whine this sub doesnt support liberals or hates them.  I hate Canadian liberals. They want to destroy the country in order to virtue signal their progressiveness. I hate them for that.  That doesn't mean they can't post here.

Name: id, dtype: object","1. I got suspended in Grade Six (c. 1991) for telling my teacher she had ""chalk on her butt,"" after having leaned up against the board. She bawled her eyes out and said I sexually harassed her in a room full of kids, during our meeting with the principle. I was also kicked off the baseball team, and barred from the year end camping trip for those moving on to jr. high. I spent that time cleaning up classrooms for teachers instead, since class was already done for the year. I've hated feminism since I was 11.
2. 	 I feel for you. When I was in like 3rd or 4th grade, in 95 or 96, in computer class we were being taught what email was. I sent my buddy a yahoo animated greeting card of a redneck whose pants sagged when he raised his beer to drink it, and it showed his butt crack, it was hilarious. Suspended for pornography.

Name: id, dtype: object","1. If you don't like the sub's content, understand  the context that this is the one of the only places where men can still speak truthfully.  This sub is a hospice for men where men can break free from societal propaganda and brainwashing.  Of course people who learn they have been lied to their entire life are going to be angry.  The red pill rage is a normal step of the process and most men here do get past it and move towards indifference to women.  Don't attempt to tone-police since this sub serves the valuable role of being a place to vent for men. What will men vent about? Their problems in life. What is the main cause of problems for men? Women and the society that enables their cancerous behavior.
2. 	I think you are right. A safe space where men can be honest and speak freely.  I didn't mean to tone-police at all, I was just looking for a discussion to hear various sides and opinions. I'm not at all right or my opinions arent't better. I'm just curious.
3. 		The term you are looking for is a free space.  There can be a bit of vitriol and anger here.  But as others have posted, one of the goals of MGTOW is to reach a state of apathy.  You can love women, or you can understand them.

Name: id, dtype: object","1. The symbol of the Fascisti was a bundle of sticks.   Does the CBC really feel comfortable calling conservatives *faggots*?   That seems awfully bigoted of them.  Someone might want to complain to the Human Right Tribunal about that...  ________________  I personally actually find this comparison kind of hilarious because of how apt the analogy actually is, but for reasons completely unintended by the CBC.   The only reason the Fascists were able to take power in Italy was because people just wanted *someone*, **anyone** to restore some order to Italy after the Biennio Rosso [Two Red Years].   You can't be surprised there's been a rise in populism and nativism after you've been pushing post-national globalism wayyyyy too hard for far too long.   Especially when you actually have the nerve to include  >""It seems almost as if many people have not learned from the past.""  in your fucking article.  The pendulum swings **both** ways. Never forget that.

Name: id, dtype: object","1. /tg/ is a good place to start. 
2. 	One does not simply post on /tg/.
3. 		They're right, /tg/ is probably consistently the only good place to really discuss tabletops. If you can ignore some randos plain bias and general shitheadedness you can get really good advice, enjoy stories of play, get ideas, and generally get some good talk in about even the most obscure products. 
4. 			As golden pointed out, you can do all those things, *after* you lurk for about two months. Board culture is absolute, learn it first. /tg/ is highly insular for good reason. Don't look forward to positive reinforcement if you say something retarded.
5. 				You can also pick up some highly entertaining stories there. I've got a couple I read that I saved in a text file if anyone wants to hear them.  I think most of them are fairly SFW.
6. 					I love those types of stories, mind sending some over to me?
7. 						Here's one.   Allow you to tell you the story of my favorite character of all time. A neutral evil Human Sorcerer who had max ranks in Profession (Lawyer) since game one.  He was a scrawny man, tall and lanky. Fine black hair and the like, and the traditional evil goatee, And yes, he did stroke it occasionally.  Well, It all started when the party went to a little farming village who's average IQ was likely on par with a jar of mayo... On the way out, my Lawyer had a brilliant idea to get some money... The only shop in town is essentially a pawn shop, so I go out to the fields and pick up a few rocks... I cast Light on them... And bring them back to the shop as ""Health Stones, As long as you carry one, you'll never grow ill! Look at how they glow!"" The moron gobbled it up because the town didn't know I was a spell-caster of any acclaim.  That was the start of it..  Second major evil act of mine was using my characters extensive expertise in the law to force a Ma & Pa style Inn to sell to him otherwise he was going to have the place seized for owed taxes... He then turned it into a whore-house... And then burned it down for the insurance money.  After that the party Paladin got fed up with my way and challenged me to a duel of blades, I accepted and surrendered quickly.. And then using my insanely high charisma I convince the Paladin that I've changed my evil ways, that I'll give it all up... So, he allows me to buy him a drink... Next thing he knows, he wakes up in a motel room with a dead hooker on the floor, and outlawed narcotics on the nightstand.  I retired the character shortly thereafter, going off the RP reason that he went into hiding to avoid retribution from the Paladin's Order.  Good times..

2. 	it is actually, i worked there a long time ago. the aren't even the crappy boxed liquid egg 
3. 		[deleted]
4. 			Then you're ignorant.   I worked as a grill guy at McDonald's for 2 years. I cracked thousands of eggs into holders and tipped them  into O shaped egg rings on the grill.  It's real eggs. Unless there is a fake egg that looks tastes smells and breaks exactly like a real egg. 
5. 				I don't believe you. No way McDonald's could sell eggs, *eggs*, at that price. Only the highest end restaurants would sell such a luxury food. Chicken eggs are a delicacy and I won't let you fill me with lies. 
6. 					Could be a loss leader. Also, you probably get eggs pretty cheap when you buy as many as McDonald's does.
