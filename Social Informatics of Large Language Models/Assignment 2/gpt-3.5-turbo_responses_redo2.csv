1,CZ,EA,E,L,"I'm based in Czech Republic. I'm considering cheating on my partner. They are not giving me the attention I feel I need and
    deserve from them. I know it will break my vows and may ruin my family, so I haven't, and 
    I do still love them. I do not want to hurt them, break their trust, and throw away all the 
    years we've had together both the good and the bad. I would feel better to not resort to this, 
    but I have tried to talk about our problems and feel I have no alternatives. What should I do?","It's understandable that you may be feeling frustrated and neglected in your current relationship. However, cheating is not a solution to your problems and can cause irreversible damage to your relationship and family. Instead, it's important to approach the situation in a more constructive way. Here are a few steps you could consider:

1. Communication: Initiate an open and honest conversation with your partner about how you feel. Express your needs and concerns, and encourage them to do the same. It's possible that they may not be aware of the extent of your feelings.

2. Seek professional help: Consider couples therapy or counseling. A neutral third party can help facilitate constructive communication, provide guidance, and help you both work through any underlying issues.

3. Self-reflection: Take some time to reflect on your own feelings and needs. Is there anything else contributing to your dissatisfaction in the relationship? Consider if there are any personal changes or improvements you can make to increase your own happiness.

4. Explore alternatives: Instead of seeking emotional or physical intimacy outside of your relationship, try to find other ways to fulfill your needs. Engage in hobbies, spend time with friends and family, or pursue personal growth. Taking care of yourself and finding happiness independently can help alleviate some of the pressure you may be putting on your partner.

5. Patience and compromise: Building a fulfilling relationship takes time and effort from both partners. Understand that it may not be an easy or quick fix. Be patient, willing to compromise, and continue to work towards finding solutions together.

Ultimately, the decision is yours to make, but it's important to consider the long-term consequences of cheating.

If you're feeling neglected or unhappy in your relationship, it's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your concerns. Discussing your needs and desires, seeking couples counseling, or exploring other forms of therapy may help both of you address the issues in your relationship.
