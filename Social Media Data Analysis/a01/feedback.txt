# first model looks good, would have an even lower BIC without seasonal vars

# second model missing
# Answer to question in the comments:
# the second model should have been a simple OLS regression 
# of weighted ili as a dependent var and the google trends value
# you got in exercise 4 as an independent variable

# third model doesn't work -> it expects the exogenous vars as a matrix
# if you pass exog=g_flu["total_volume"].values.reshape(-1, 1) as an argument it works

# plot + discussion missing
