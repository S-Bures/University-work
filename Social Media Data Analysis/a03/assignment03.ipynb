    "For YouTube, the BERT and GoogleNLP models have near identical results. The accuracy is high on both, as are recall and precision both positively and negatively. GoogleNLP's positive YouTube F1 score is marginally higher than BERT's however BERT was slightly better at correctly detecting negative sentiment. VADER, while only a little lower in all positive statistics, seems to suffer greatly on the negative sentiment. This could be due to the thresholds we used. Perhaps if the threshold was lowered a little then maybe more texts would be classified as negative rather than neutral. High precision and low recall shows that it may not classify many texts as negative but the ones it does classify are mostly correct. Maybe VADER finds it easier to classify positively and give a more positive score that goes over our threshold, or maybe YouTube and Twitter data isn't negative enough for it to classify it as negative. I don't know what data GoogleNLP is trained on exactly, but Google owns YouTube so it may have some YouTube data in the training data. It's surprising that BERT is able to be level with GoogleNLP given it was trained on Twitter data. VADER is also fairly good even though it hasn't been trained on such data either, except for the negative sentiment as explained earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Twitter, again GoogleNLP and BERT are very similar. GoogleNLP is slightly better again at positive sentiment while BERT is marginally better than GoogleNLP at correctly identifying negative tweets, seen mostly in the negativs recalls and the F1 scores. Again, VADER is only slightly worse than both at the postive tweet detection and classification but the negative tweets, similarly to Twitter, are not being detected when they should be, instead classfied as neutral, which is seen in the very low negative recall. It's not a surprise that BERT is doing well on this data, as it is a Twitter-trained sentiment analyser. GoogleNLP does well to keep up. It probably isn't trained on Twitter but is doing about as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a disparity between the positive and negative sentiment classification. BERT is the most balanced, as in there isn't as much of a differnce between the precision, recall, and therefore F1 of both Twitter and YouTube data. The largest differences for BERT are the precision of YouTube data and the recall of Twitter data. It means BERT is not correctly classifying negative YouTube data as much as positive data and the Twitter data that is classified as negative is correct but it's not classifying all the negative data there is. VADER has by far the largest difference between negative and positive classification. Positive classification is about on par with the other two models but it suffers in the negative classification, specifically in the recall. This means that whatever is being classified as negative is generally actually negative, but it is missing a lot of negative tweets and comments for Twitter and YouTube respectively. "

    "Preprocessing could include making sure slang words are either excluded or taken into account. I don't actually know if LEIA does take them into account, probably it does, because I know the people behind it are very smart. While not preprocessing, it may be important to define the emotion words we have. It's very difficult, but different people may interpret these words slightly differently or have a different idea of what they should mean. It would be interesting to see if the results are different if an entire sentence is included, as some of the sentences cut off. Glancing through them, the emotion changes sometimes as the text goes along, so maybe that also influences the final emotion and why the emotion changes when the first first words are cut out."

    "#### 7.3 Openai models\n",
    "* In the following exercise we will work with the [openai API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference), an API which allows you to access very powerful AI models. Your task will be to use a [text completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/) or a [chat completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction) model to classify the sentences in `sample_with_labels.csv` according to their emotion (Sadness, Affection, Fear, Happiness, Anger).\n",
    "* You can sign up for the API by providing a phone number, and get 5 USD of free credits, which should be more than enough to complete this exercise.\n",
    "* If you use your own account, you can use any text completion/chat completion model to complete the exercise, you are also allowed to [fine-tune](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes) one of the text completion models, and use it for classification.\n",
    "* If you can't/don't want to sign up for the API, we created an API wrapper, through wich you can use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. We set a limit of 1_000_000 tokens per API key, which should be more than enough to complete the task, so feel free to experiment to find the best prompt.\n",
    "* In your `a03` folder, you can find a file named `api_key.txt`, which stores your API key you will need to use the API wrapper. ***Important: this is not a real openai API key, we use it internally in the API wrapper, to monitor usage***\n",
    "* To set up the API wrapper with the openai module, run the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import openai\n",
    "openai.api_base = 'https://smdapi-1-a6938250.deta.app'\n",
    "your_api_key = '' # your key from api_key.txt\n",
    "openai.api_key = your_api_key\n",
    "```\n",
    "* After you run this setup, you can use the `openai.ChatCompletion.create` function just like when your are using the openai module ([documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat)).\n",
    "* Store the results in a column named `label_gpt`."

    "LEIA is quite accurate, getting most of the labels correct. Interestingly, the ones where it's not correct, a few times it chooses the same as the human who also got it wrong. It shows that this dataset is super subjective, especially a few texts where all four labels or at least three are different. Sometimes the text is also multiple emotions, which makes sense when one remembers this a website for people tp talk about their feelings, and sometimes one just writes a long stream of consciousness that doesn't really make a lot of sense and has high emotion but not always the same emotion throughout. A couple texts also completely change emotion at the very end, perhaps after LEIA is cutting the text to the maximum of 128 tokens. This also affects the accuracy and precision of the emotion analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI actually isn't too bad at predicting the emotions. There are a couple texts where it disagrees with the label and both LEIA and the human, and also for a couple it insisted on not using the five words given to it, either saying there is no sentiment (which I would actually agree on and I mislabeled it as well) or somehow coming up with new words, confusion and frustration. The frustration one makes sense, as does fit the text, and both human and LEIA are different to the real label, but that's not what was asked of it, and the same for the one labeled confusion."
