my life is nothing. ,
I'm also scared ive fucked up,
Woke up at 4am...still cannot fall asleep and I have a horrid headache...grrr,
GUYS I SAW THE HOT GUY FROM CHURCH TODAY AND I GOT SO HAPPY I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN!!!,
i only like black guys ,
Why can't everything be more simple?,
We are going to travel the world together one day. ,
When your boyfriend cheats on you😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊,
i literally have no idea what i was even trying to say to my friend. it just came out like gibberish,
I really don't want to go to school today i have too many things to do. ,
Went bra shopping yesterday and now I feel really sad. I can't find my size anymore in primary because I'm to big. Mum says it's what all the girls want but I really don't. ,
"My boyfriend <3 <3 <3 <3 I can't wait to see him again, oh my gosh. I won't say today was perfect, but I had a really good time with him. I really didn't want him to leave. And I probably won't see him for at least a week.... He has exams next week, so he needs to study and he has reports to write. I should take this time to refocus myself as well. ",
This weekend is stressing me out. I have to be up early every morning and I'll be in a hotel room with 5 other people. I feel like I'm going to annoy them cuz I don't know most of them very well. My friend keeps inviting people and I told her I didn't want to go but she says it'll be fun. Can we just fast forward to Sunday pls 😁,
I'm just remembering that I texted 🤓 on Thanksgiving and told him how grateful I was to have him and he told me that nobody ever says those things to him and that was the day I promised myself I would always tell him how important he is,
"Love is blind, so let's have a love so deep that even a blindman could see it. So who's interested 😜",
"I try to really make an effort with you, but everything keeps failing and you will never ever know how you make me feel ",
"Having issues opening the app again. Really hope I can keep accessing it, last time I couldn't was a nightmare.",
G-Eazy has my heart now. ♥,
I want some friends in my new area but I have no idea how to make friends!,
"yay we finally got the update so hey all my lovely friends of vent, this means I'm back!!! 💕",
"Yeah your busy, too busy to Even say hey?",
"Something that pisses me off with this class work is when they are like ""Explain why answer B is the best answer""Because it\'s the right fucking answer??? What more do you want from me",
You get upset when your phone doesn't work and we can't be together and when our time gets cut off because it's one of the most precious things in the world to you. #noonelikeyou,
Got nominated for a blog award! Looking forward to sharing it with you guys ,
If anyone knows how to work those shiny Yveltal scratch cards please let me know because they're the same as the shiny Xerneas ones where you either scratch so lightly you don't do anything or you apply a little bit of pressure and the grey covering and the code get ripped off and you just _can't read it._I was given three cards and for _each_ and have not been able to get a shiny Yveltal or Xerneas I was promised _hell yeah I'm furious._,
I get that hes busy. I dont blame him for ignoring me. There are things much more important than me. Im glad hes taking care of himself first. Im not the only mentally ill one i know how tired he is. I understand and thats what makes it so much worse that i still want him to love me.,
AHHHHHH! I JUST FOUND TWO NEW SONGS I LOVE! LISTEN TO THE SONGS CAR RADIO AND KITCHEN SINK IF YOU WANT PURE FUCKING HEAVEN IN YOUR EARS.,
"""Now that you love her everything has changed""...I loved her when we were still best friends. What changed is that you were jealo0us enough t0o think that we will change. I didnt change with you. And unkess you make me, i never will",
"I have a math project and two extra credit papers due tomorrow, they’re all creative writing based and I’m just drawing blanks!! and I’d really like to go get a burger and get to bed early since picture day is tomorrow but at this rate it’ll be late at night before I finish.",
I just wish I could tell my mom these things,
