# University work
This is a repository of all the work I can show from my masters degree


## Data Wrangling and Visualization with Tidyverse: 
  A selection of the data and visualizations created in this class with the R package Tidyverse. This 4th semester class was focused on how simple it is to create beautiful and informative graphics with Tidyverse and the surrounding packages. 

## Social Informatics of Large Language Models
  In this 3rd semester class, we labeled hate speech text with GPT 3.5-turbo, Flan T5, and Roberta in the first assignment and asked moral questions of GPT in the second. For the project I along with 2 other students investigated which prompting techniques worked best on which types of questions.

## Social Media Data Analysis
  This 2nd semester class touched on NLP methodology with sentiment analysis, network analysis of Twitter follows, before culminating in a solo project. In my project I investigated collective memory, that is how people remember events similar to a current one by looking at Wikipedia page views of similar pages before and after soemthing occurs. 

## Thesis
  My thesis was concerning the way survey researchers can use LLMs to label large amounts of text and the degree of accuracy to which they can do that. I concluded that while the best models cannot yet be on par with human labelers, a fine-tuned model on a very small selection of data can surpass human performance at a fraction of the time and cost.
